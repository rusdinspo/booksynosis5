The ideal text for the full-year history course, it surveys the entire span of Western art from prehistory to the present and offers overviews of significant areas of non-Western art. Features: * New to this edition: * Increased number of illustrations, more in colour. * Heightened visual appeal and superior accuracy of colour resulting from printing at 175-line screen resolution. * Addition of new maps, timelines, and improved photographic views. * Reorganized, expanded, and revised chapters in Part One reflect significant changes in the field of ancient art over the last decade. (Author Fred S. Kleiner, Classical scholar, is Editor-in-Chief of the American Journal of Archaeology, the official journal of the Archaeological Institute of America). * Inclusion of more art from North American museums facilitates students&#39; viewing of actual works. * Inclusion of many new views of previously illustrated monuments. * Increased attention to social and political context of works of art in the ancient world. * Presentation of more classical works of art created for non-elite patrons. * Reorganized by Early Christian, Islamic, and Byzantine material. * Addition of twenty-eight new line art figures. * Expanded coverage of Chinese art and introduction of Korean art. * Expanded coverage of Mayan ceramics ans stelae, new coverage of Peruvian textiles and Colombian goldwork. * Revision of African art, updated in a separate chapter with twice as many images as the previous edition. * Reorganized chapters covering Northern and Italian Renaissance. * Reorganized coverage of eighteenth-century material. * Increased coverage of women and minority artists. * Totally reorganized nineteenth- and twentieth-century material, many new images from nineteenth- and twentieth-century artists.</p><p>No art history student can get through a semester without the twin doorstops of <i>Art Through the Ages.</i> Chronicling the history of art from the earliest known cave paintings to postmodern architecture, as well as most major artists, works, and styles in between, these books are must-haves for those interested in understanding art in context. Both books are surveys, and experts may notice the omission of more esoteric movements and artists. Regardless, these volumes are invaluable references--especially since each edition of this classic improves noticeably in its coverage of non-Western art.Tansey and Kleiner have collaborated on the most thorough revision since 1970 of one of the central monuments of art-historical study. Extensively reorganized and rewritten, this massive book now contains five more chapters than the 9th edition. Among the beneficiaries are both African and Etruscan art, which each have their own chapter for the first time. Somewhat larger, more colorful illustrations, maps, and chronologies add to the overall improved look of this new version. As before, the prose is dense but readable, focusing primarily on appreciative descriptions of exemplary works and emphasizing the periodicity of artistic style. In a new concluding chapter, the authors acknowledge recent revisionist challenges to this more traditional approach. It's a cursory tip of the hat to postmodernism, followed by unconvincing attempts to legislate categories within the art of the 1980s and 1990s. Far better is the way most of the book deals with earlier eras, so that this remains the benchmark text against which all other general surveys can be measured. An improvement upon an already first-rate work; highly recommended.?Douglas F.

Lee wrote to General Ulysses S. Grant asking for peace. Peace was beyond his authority to negotiate, Grant replied, but surrender terms he would discuss. As Gregory Downs reveals in this gripping history of post&#x2013;Civil War America, Grant&#x2019;s distinction proved prophetic, for peace would elude the South for years after Lee&#x2019;s surrender at Appomattox.</p><p><i>After Appomattox</i> argues that the war did not end with Confederate capitulation in 1865. Instead, a second phase commenced which lasted until 1871&#x2015;not the project euphemistically called Reconstruction but a state of genuine belligerency whose mission was to shape the terms of peace. Using its war powers, the U.S. Army oversaw an ambitious occupation, stationing tens of thousands of troops in hundreds of outposts across the defeated South. This groundbreaking study of the post-surrender occupation makes clear that its purpose was to crush slavery and to create meaningful civil and political rights for freed people in the face of rebels&#x2019; bold resistance.</p><p>But reliance on military occupation posed its own dilemmas. In areas beyond Army control, the Ku Klux Klan and other violent insurgencies created near-anarchy. Voters in the North also could not stomach an expensive and demoralizing occupation. Under those pressures, by 1871, the Civil War came to its legal end. The wartime after Appomattox disrupted planter power and established important rights, but the dawn of legal peacetime heralded the return of rebel power, not a sustainable peace.</p></p><p>Gregory P. Downs is Professor of History at the University of California, Davis, and has received the university&#x2019;s Distinguished Scholarly Public Service Award. He co-wrote the National Park Service&#x2019;s theme study on the Reconstruction and helped create an interactive digital history of the U.S. Army&#x2019;s occupation of the South. He is the author of <i>Declarations of Dependence: The Long Reconstruction of Popular Politics in the South, 1861-1908.</i>&#x201c;Downs persuasively argues that a long and persistent &#x2018;occupation&#x2019; occurred for at least three years, and perhaps as long as six years, after the end of actual hostilities in spring, 1865. Downs also demonstrates that, although a massive demobilization of Union troops occurred in 1865&#x2013;66, the United States Army has been far too neglected as a player&#x2015;a force&#x2015;in the history of Reconstruction... Downs wants his work to speak to the present, and indeed it should.&#x201d;<b><i>&#x2015;</i></b><b>David W. Blight</b><b>, </b><b><i>The Atlantic</i></b><br><br>&#x201c;[Downs] makes a persuasive...case that virtually none of the achievements of Reconstruction&#x2015;there were more than is generally supposed&#x2015;could have taken place without the use or at least the threat of military force. He challenges the view that defeated Confederates in 1865 were ready to acquiesce in whatever reorganization the federal government imposed on them, including the bestowal of civil rights on blacks... Downs rightly regards the appalling white-on-black violence of the late 1860s and early 1870s as systemic terrorism... In Downs&#x2019;s telling, Reconstruction was also one of the finest hours of the U.S. Army.&#x201d;<b><i>&#x2015;</i></b><b>Fergus M. Bordewich</b><b>, </b><b><i>Wall Street Journal</i></b><br><br>&#x201c;In <i>After Appomattox</i>, Downs makes the case that the final end to slavery, and the establishment of basic civil and voting rights for all Americans, was &#x2018;born in the face of bayonets.&#x2019; Put simply, the military occupation created democracy as we know it. Downs&#x2019; book couldn&#x2019;t come at a more opportune time, as American forces once again face the difficult question of how long, and to what ends, an occupying army must stay in conquered territory. After more than a decade of fighting abroad, we may be too war-weary to see that military occupations are sometimes a good, even necessary thing... The brilliance of Downs&#x2019; argument is that he steals the central complaint of the apologists, yet reverses the conclusion: The federal government was overzealous&#x2015;and that was a <i>good</i> thing. Congress had to impose martial law in order for blacks to gain basic freedoms. If military officers sometimes vacated racist local laws, if they removed ruthless sheriffs and judges, if they tried white supremacists in unfair military tribunals&#x2015;all of which they did&#x2015;they did so for necessary ends. Equality would come to the South no other way... Downs has produced a remarkable, necessary book.&#x201d;<b><i>&#x2015;</i></b><b>Eric Herschthal</b><b>, </b><b><i>Slate</i></b><br><br>&#x201c;In a striking new book, <i>After Appomattox</i>, historian Gregory Downs chronicles the years of military occupation that followed Lee&#x2019;s surrender to Grant in 1865&#x2015;a military occupation that was indispensable to the uprooting of slavery and the political empowerment of freed slaves. In the face of Southern white supremacist hostility, it was only the continuing presence of federal troops in the South that could break up remaining pockets of rebellion, establish the right of blacks to vote and seek election, void discriminatory laws, and unilaterally remove disloyal or racist sheriffs and judges from office.&#x201d;<b><i>&#x2015;</i></b><b>Jeff Jacoby</b><b>, </b><b><i>Boston Globe</i></b><br><br>&#x201c;Downs resets our sights on the military occupation that did occur, and he argues for its centrality in helping to fashion whatever gains African-Americans managed to achieve. In talking about military occupation, numbers matter, and his research has fixed them with a precision previously lacking... <i>After Appomattox</i> is a timely, important book that casts new light on the meaning of occupation during Reconstruction, and raises challenging questions about the relationship between military power and civil rights in today&#x2019;s climate of never-ending war.&#x201d;<b><i>&#x2015;</i></b><b>Louis P. Masur</b><b>, </b><b><i>Chronicle of Higher Education</i></b><br><br>&#x201c;Downs has written an important book challenging assumptions about the post&#x2013;Civil War era and the ways in which historians define &#x2018;wartime&#x2019; and &#x2018;peacetime.&#x2019; He contends that Lee&#x2019;s surrender at Appomattox did not bring peace, but rather a second phase of war&#x2015;an insurgency and war of occupation that did not &#x2018;end&#x2019; until 1871. Downs problematizes the idea of &#x2018;reconstruction.&#x2019; Whatever accomplishments came in that era&#x2015;civil rights, a national definition of citizenship&#x2015;came as a result of military force rather than deliberative politics. Challenging scholars who argue that too few Union troops for a meaningful occupation remained in the postwar South, Downs demonstrates through impressive research that there was actually a significant military presence, both numerically and geographically. But even this presence had its limits, and outside the pale, terrorists and violence plagued the South. By framing the period as an occupation and insurgency, the author has done much to reveal the violent, contested, and contingent nature of the post&#x2013;Civil War US. Required reading for scholars of the Civil War era.&#x201d;<b><i>&#x2015;</i></b><b>K. M. Gannon</b><b>, </b><b><i>Choice</i></b><br><br>&#x201c;Downs examines Reconstruction as primarily a military operation. In order to secure civil rights for freed slaves, Northern republicans had to rely on additional constitutional war powers. From a legal standpoint, the Civil War did not end with the surrender of Confederate armies but lasted until 1871 when Georgia&#x2019;s senator was seated. While many opponents of Reconstruction were motivated by racism, others were compelled by a fear of unchecked military power. How to approach Reconstruction even divided radical Republicans. Downs convincingly argues that the U.S. government should have expanded and extended the use of war powers in the South in order to secure justice and freedom for freed slaves... This work will appeal to general readers as well as specialists interested in a fresh understanding of Reconstruction.&#x201d;<b><i>&#x2015;</i></b><b>Michael Farrell</b><b>, </b><b><i>Library Journal</i></b><br><br>&#x201c;<i>After Appomattox</i> demonstrates how a long and ambitious military occupation aimed to secure freedom for the newly emancipated in the violent, lawless, and chaotic South.

It&#x2019;s to be hoped that America&#x2019;s decision makers get their hands on a copy of <i>The Arabs</i> &#x2013; and take very good notes.&#x201d;<br><br><b><i>Foreign Affairs</i></b><br> &#x201c;Readable and reliable, this sweeping survey balances the unity of a coherent story with due attention to detail. As such, Rogan&#x2019;s contribution belongs in the company of the earlier classics by Hitti and Hourani.&#x201d;<br><b>Avi Shlaim, author of <i>The Iron Wall: Israel and the Arab World</i></b><br> &#x201c;Eugene Rogan writes about the Middle East with exceptional empathy, wisdom, and insight. His book is a landmark in scholarship on this complex and controversial region. Western scholars have written extensively about the Middle East but mostly from the outside looking in. The Arabs often feature in their accounts as mere driftwood on the sea of international affairs. Rogan, by contrast, has narrated the history of the region over the last five centuries from the inside looking out. He tells the history of the Arabs from their own perspective, using an impressive range of Arabic sources. It is a fascinating story and in Eugene Rogan it has found its most gifted chronicler.&#x201d;<br><br><b>Sir Alistair Horne, author of <i>A Savage War of Peace</i></b><br> &#x201c;Anyone who seeks to understand why the Islamic world bears a grudge against the West should read <i>The Arabs</i>. Few scholars know their subject better than Eugene Rogan, while even fewer are capable of rendering so complex a subject so engagingly readable. It is a joy to open, and a deprivation to put down.&#x201d;<br><b>Margaret MacMillan, author of <i>Paris 1919</i> and <i>Nixon and Mao</i></b><br> &#x201c;With eloquence, verve, and understanding, Eugene Rogan rightly reminds us that the world, and the Arabs themselves, need to remember the past. If we are to build a better relationship between the Arab world and the West, if we are to avoid making the same mistakes again and again, we need to know Arab history from its many high points to its low ones. I can think of no better guide on this crucially important journey than <i>The Arabs</i>.&#x201d;<br><p><b><i>Kirkus</i></b><br> &#x201c;A straightforward, careful primer on Arab political history from the rise of the Ottoman Empire to the forging of modern fundamentalist Islamic entities....

The bonobo, least known of the great apes, is a female-centered, egalitarian species that has been dubbed the "make-love-not-war" primate by specialists. In bonobo society, females form alliances to intimidate males, sexual behavior (in virtually every partner combination) replaces aggression and serves many social functions, and unrelated groups mingle instead of fighting. The species's most striking achievement is not tool use or warfare but sensitivity to others.<br><br>In the first book to combine and compare data from captivity and the field, Frans de Waal, a world-renowned primatologist, and Frans Lanting, an internationally acclaimed wildlife photographer, present the most up-to-date perspective available on the bonobo. Focusing on social organization, de Waal compares the bonobo with its better-known relative, the chimpanzee. The bonobo's relatively nonviolent behavior and the tendency for females to dominate males confront the evolutionary models derived from observing the chimpanzee's male power politics, cooperative hunting, and intergroup warfare. Further, the bonobo's frequent, imaginative sexual contacts, along with its low reproduction rate, belie any notion that the sole natural purpose of sex is procreation. Humans share over 98 percent of their genetic material with the bonobo and the chimpanzee. Is it possible that the peaceable bonobo has retained traits of our common ancestor that we find hard to recognize in ourselves?<br><br>Eight superb full-color photo essays offer a rare view of the bonobo in its native habitat in the rain forests of Zaire as well as in zoos and research facilities. Additional photographs and highlighted interviews with leading bonobo experts complement the text. This book points the way to viable alternatives to male-based models of human evolution and will add considerably to debates on the origin of our species. Anyone interested in primates, gender issues, evolutionary psychology, and exceptional wildlife photography will find a fascinating companion in <i>Bonobo: The Forgotten Ape</i>.</p><p>For Frans de Waal, man is not the only moral entity, as he made clear in his last book--<i>Good Natured: The Origins of Right and Wrong in Humans and Other Animals.</i> The author has long been intrigued by chimpanzee politics and mores, and now he has turned his human heart and scientific mind to a species science has tended to celebrate solely for its sex drive. Bonobos may look like chimps, but they are actually even closer to us--far more upright, physically, for a start. Furthermore, where chimpanzees hunt, fight, and politic like mad, bonobos are peaceful, often ambisexual, and matriarchal. (Of course, hyenas are matriarchal too, but that's another story ...) De Waal's collaborator, Frans Lanting, has been photographing these gentle creatures for some years and augments the primatologist's explorations and interviews with hundreds of superb color shots. The penultimate picture is of bonobos crossing a road while schoolchildren stand watching, a short distance away. If, as the truism goes, all books about animal behavior are ultimately about us, this exploration of the bonobo may be a step in the right direction."Here at last is a book that will give the fourth great ape the visibility that this wonderful species deserves. You will learn that bonobos are not just 'little' chimpanzees, but are every bit as different from chimpanzees as chimpanzees are from gorillas. If you care about the great apes, this book, with its superb photographs and vivid text, is a must."&#x2014;Jane Goodall<br><br>"Bonobo provides a tantalizing introduction into the natural history of one of our closest living relatives and uniquely enhances our understanding of our own place in Nature. Anyone who has the pleasure of reading this book will come away with deeper insights into why we humans behave the way we do. We should not be afraid of acknowledging the Bonobo in all of us."&#x2014;Don Johanson, Director, Institute of Human Origins<br><br>"With this book, de Waal and Lanting ask us to give bonobos their due&#x2014;to be considered along side the better known common chimpanzee as close human cousins. How nice to have the peaceable, sexy, bonobo added to the path of human evolution! Bonobos represent the silver lining in our ape heritage."&#x2014;Meredith Small, author of <i>What's Love Got to Do With It? The Evolution of Human Mating</i><br><br>"As a chronicler of natural history today, Frans Lanting is a singular, extraordinary talent. He has the mind of a scientist, the heart of a hunter, and the eyes of a poet. He is as persistent, adaptable, and hard as the wild creatures he observes. His bonobo photographs bring us face-to-face with a group of highly endangered apes. Eerily, aspects of their behavior mirror our own."&#x2014;Thomas R.

A specialist in New England transcendentalism and the history of the antebellum period, he also has published on Herman Melville&#x2019;s poetry. He currently is writing a history of Emerson&#x2019;s career as a public lecturer. <br><br><b>From Peter Norberg's Introduction to <i>Essays and Poems by Ralph Waldo Emerson</i></b> <p>In the face of this new materialism, Emerson feared that America was losing its most valuable resource&#x2014;the individual&#x2014;as men and women increasingly defined themselves in terms of their professions and their possessions. "The tradesman scarcely ever gives an ideal worth to his work, but is ridden by the routine of his craft, and the soul is subject to dollars," he lamented in "The American Scholar." "The priest becomes a form; the attorney, a statute-book; the mechanic, a machine; the sailor, a rope of a ship". The alienation that results from conformity could be overcome only by a radical break with custom and tradition. "If you maintain a dead church, contribute to a dead Bible society, vote with a great party either for the Government or against it," he wrote in "Self-Reliance," ". . . under all these screens I have difficulty to detect the precise man you are. . . . But do your work, and I shall know you. Do your work, and you shall reinforce yourself" . For Emerson, our ability to think and act on our own terms was ultimately the strongest corrective to conformity. "In all of my lectures," he wrote in his journal in 1840, "I have preached one doctrine, namely, the infinitude of the private man" (<i>Journals and Miscellaneous Notebooks</i>, vol. 7, p. 342; see "For Further Reading"). By keeping this a continual refrain throughout his career, he placed the individual at the center of American culture as a critical counterforce to the mentality of mass consumerism. Today, when the pressures placed on individuals to conform to the material values of American culture are perhaps stronger than ever, readers young and old will find Emerson's essays a resource for personal, intellectual, and professional renewal. </p><p>The emphasis Emerson placed on the individual was grounded in his theological beliefs. Human life, as well as nature, was a manifestation of divinity. In moments of genuine inspiration or original action, the individual did not think or act from himself but was a conduit for what Emerson variously referred to as "Supreme Mind," "Universal Being," or "the Over-soul." "We lie in the lap of immense intelligence, which makes us organs of its activity and receivers of its truth," he wrote in "Self-Reliance." "When we discern justice, when we discern truth, we do nothing of ourselves, but allow a passage to its beams". This fact is easy to overlook in an increasingly secular world, but it is essential for understanding the difference between Emersonian self-reliance and what Albert J. von Frank has termed the "predatory individualism" of the expansionist era. </p><p>Equally important is some knowledge of Emerson's personal experience of the transient nature of human life. From his childhood until the middle of his life, Emerson lived through the tragic loss of those closest to him. His father died less than two weeks before Emerson's eighth birthday; his three-year-old sister, Mary Caroline, when he was ten. His first wife, Ellen Tucker, suffered from tuberculosis, and Emerson probably knew she would die young when they married. Still, when she succumbed to the disease at the age of nineteen, before their second wedding anniversary, he was devastated. </p><p>Tuberculosis was widespread in New England. Emerson showed symptoms of it himself. It claimed the lives of two of his brothers, Edward at the age of twenty-nine and Charles at thirty-two. They were his closest confidants. Following Charles's funeral, Emerson is reported to have said, "When one has never had but little society&#x2014;and all that society is taken away&#x2014;what is there worth living for?" Finally, in 1842, when Emerson was thirty-eight and happily married to his second wife, Lydia Jackson, their eldest son, Waldo, died of scarlet fever. He was five. Emerson's optimistic affirmations of the individual take on new urgency when read in light of this litany of loss. </p><p>When he writes in <i>Nature</i> that our "relation to the world . . . is not to be learned by any addition or subtraction or other comparison of known quantities, but is arrived at by untaught sallies of the spirit, by a continual self-recovery, and by entire humility", the "self-recovery" he speaks of is not simply a return to one's sense of self. It is a recovery from our failures, and especially from the failure of what we thought we knew, in the face of experiences that indicate otherwise. At times in his essays, Emerson will entertain the deepest skepticism. "No picture of life can have any veracity that does not admit the odious facts", he wrote in "Fate." Among these facts is the awful truth that not just our knowledge, but our loves and friendships are partial and temporary. "Souls never touch their objects," he wrote in "Experience." "An unnavigable sea washes with silent waves between us and the things we aim at and converse with". And yet, in the face of these facts, Emerson still affirms the beauty and value of human life. Confronting the mixed bag of human experience&#x2014;what he jokingly calls "the pot-luck of the day"&#x2014;he insists that "if we will take the good we find, asking no questions, we shall have heaping measures". These are not the words of an idealistic dreamer, as Emerson has sometimes been portrayed. They are an expression of his confidence in man's ability to meet and master his circumstances; they are a call for a pragmatic engagement of the world in which we find ourselves.</p></p><h2>Remembering the Kanji, Vol. 1: A Complete Course on How Not to Forget the Meaning and Writing of Japanese Characters (English and Japanese Edition)</h2><p>The aim of this book is to provide the student of Japanese with a simple method for correlating the writing and the meaning of Japanese characters in such a way as to make them both easy to remember. It is intended not only for the beginner, but also for the more advanced student looking for some relief from the constant frustration of how to write the kanji and some way to systematize what he or she already knows. The author begins with writing because--contrary to first impressions--it is in fact the simpler of the two. He abandons the traditional method of ordering the kanji according to their frequency of use and organizes them according to their component parts or "primitive elements." Assigning each of these parts a distinct meaning with its own distinct image, the student is led to harness the powers of "imaginative memory" to learn the various combinations that result. In addition, each kanji is given its own key word to represent the meaning, or one of the principal meanings, of that character. These key words provide the setting for a particular kanji's "story," whose protagonists are the primitive elements. <p>In this way, students are able to complete in a few short months a task that would otherwise take years. Armed with the same skills as Chinese or Korean students, who know the meaning and writing of the kanji but not their pronunciation in Japanese, they are now in a much better position to learn to read (which is treated in a separate volume).</p></p><p><b>James W.

Through a near-fatal road accident at the age of 18, failing health, a turbulent marriage, miscarriage and childlessness, she transformed the afflictions into revolutionary art.</p><p>In literal or metaphorical self-portraiture, Kahlo looks out at the viewer with an audacious glare, rejecting her destiny as a passive victim and rather intertwining expressions of her experience into a hybrid real-surreal language of living: hair, roots, veins, vines, tendrils and fallopian tubes. Many of her works also explore the Communist political ideals which Kahlo shared with her husband Diego Rivera.

Each situation posed challenges that usually required an exercise of judgment, an understanding of regulations, knowledge of science, a grasp of compliance, and an appreciation of common practices.</p> <p>Since early 2000, I have also been involved with several training opportunities and I struggled to find good, concise, practical resources, one of which I can just hand to a new scientist who wishes to gain more understanding of stability sciences. In addition, I encountered the same questions posted over and over on different stability best practices discussion forums. </p> <p>As a book lover, I also have a good collection of technical books. Unfortunately, most of the stability related books are outdated. In addition, many of these materials are theoretical and do not contain much practical information. I understand that the pharmaceutical industry during this period is quite volatile, and guidelines are changing rapidly while regulatory agencies are working closely with the pharmaceutical industry to accommodate these changes; however, the fundamental information continues to remain quite the same as current Good Manufacturing Practices (cGMP) continues to be the standard industry practice. Therefore, I hope to assemble a practical handbook to fill this void.</p></p><h2>It Was a Long Time Ago, and It Never Happened Anyway: Russia and the Communist Past</h2><p><p><b>A veteran writer on Russia and the Soviet Union explains why Russia refuses to draw from the lessons of its past and what this portends for the future</b><br><br> Russia today is haunted by deeds that have not been examined and words that have been left unsaid. A serious attempt to understand the meaning of the Communist experience has not been undertaken, and millions of victims of Soviet Communism are all but forgotten. In this book David Satter, a former Moscow correspondent and longtime writer on Russia and the Soviet Union, presents a striking new interpretation of Russia's great historical tragedy, locating its source in Russia's failure fully to appreciate the value of the individual in comparison with the objectives of the state.&nbsp;</p><p>Satter explores the moral and spiritual crisis of Russian society. He shows how it is possible for a government to deny the inherent value of its citizens and for the population to agree, and why so many Russians actually mourn the passing of the Soviet regime that denied them fundamental rights. Through a wide-ranging consideration of attitudes toward the living and the dead, the past and the present, the state and the individual, Satter arrives at a distinctive and important new way of understanding the Russian experience.</p></p><p>This compelling and original book explores why Russia has ignored the lessons of its tragic Communist experience and shows how a deep-rooted lack of respect for the individual blocks the nation&#39;s way to a stable and democratic future.<b>David Satter</b> is senior fellow, Hudson Institute, and fellow, Foreign Policy Institute of Johns Hopkins University School of Advanced International Studies.

She currently maintains a sexuality blog at tinynibbles.com and can be found on Twitter, @violetblue.Gr 10 Up&#x2014;A thorough (but flawed) look at Internet protection aimed squarely at female users. There is a battle to be fought, and the author intends to arm the female population with the critical information they need to protect their privacy. In her least objective moments, Blue, an investigative tech reporter and self-described agitator, posits that "you actually can post or share sexy pictures of yourself and stay in control." She also states that "filthy-rich celebrities are more able than the rest of us to hide things they consider private or embarrassing because they can afford to" and should therefore keep their social media privacy suggestions to themselves. The plethora of nude celebrity photo hacking scandals seems to contradict this assertion. References to companies as "greedy" and "douchey" are further examples of biased opinion presented as fact. Blue offers clear suggestions on how to avoid becoming an Internet victim, but her unwavering confidence in her own opinions and ardor for the topic make her advice seem heavy-handed at times, which may put off teens. VERDICT This informative but flawed book works best as a resource for victims in search of a staunch advocate or as an option for adults, who can better separate the opinions from the useful facts.&#x2014;Cindy Wall, Southington Library &amp; Museum, CT</p><h2>Corporate Finance</h2><p><p> <b>For MBA/graduate students taking a course in corporate finance.</b> <br> <br>Using the unifying valuation framework based on the Law of One Price, top researchers Jonathan Berk and Peter DeMarzo set the new standard for corporate finance textbooks. <i>Corporate Finance</i> blends coverage of time-tested principles and the latest advancements with the practical perspective of the financial manager.

The Hungarian-born artist&#39;s interpretation of the strange and gripping tale, told by the sole survivor of a cursed voyage, constitutes a wondrously dramatic marriage of words and images. Pog�ny&#39;s vision offers the print equivalent of a medieval manuscript, rich in sumptuously hand-lettered text, decorative borders, illuminated scripts, and numerous marginal illustrations as well as 20 full-page color plates. A handy, plain text version of the poem can be downloaded for free from the Dover website after purchase.</p><p>Gustave Dore's magnificent engravings for <i>The Rime of the Ancient Mariner</i> are among the later works of the great French illustrator. The intensely evocative poem provided Dor� with the long-awaited opportunity to convey limitless space on a gigantic scale, and he exploited the poem's fantastic range of atmosphere to the limits of its possibilities. The terrifying space of the open sea, the storms and whirlpools of an unknown ocean, the vast icy caverns of Antarctica, the hot equatorial sea swarming with monsters, all of the amazing visual elements that make Coleridge's masterpiece one of the most exciting and most memorable poems in the English language are unforgettably engraved in Dor�'s plates.<br>This edition reproduces all of the plates to perfection, in their original size. The illustrations and the text of the poem appear on facing pages, so that the imaginative kinship of Dor� and Coleridge is delightfully evident on every page: the illustrations capture all the moods of the poem in their full intensity, bringing the images evoked by the words into clear visual focus.<br>Unabridged and slightly rearranged republication of the 1878 American edition.

Coyote, Pep� Le Pew, and Marvin Martian. In this beguiling memoir, Chuck Jones evokes the golden years of life at "Termite Terrace," the Warner Bros. studio in which he and his now-famous fellow animators conceived the cartoons that delighted millions of moviegoers throughout the world and entertain new generations of fans on television. Not a mere history, <i>Chuck Amuck</i> captures the antic spirit that created classic cartoons-such as Duck Dodgers in the 241/2 Century, One Froggy Evening, Duck Amuck, and What's Opera, Doc?-with some of the wittiest insights into the art of comedy since Mark Twain.<br></p><p><i>Chuck Amuck: The Life and Times of an Animated Cartoonist</i> is a sort of autobiography of Chuck Jones, the brilliant Warner Brothers animator who created such enduring characters as Wile E. Coyote and Marvin the Martian. Like his best cartoons, Jones skips around to the fun parts, giving a bit of childhood here, a few words of drawing advice there, and a good yarn wherever one fits. Jones also manages to work in a detailed yet somehow never boring description of the long and silly process of making a cartoon. Jones is refreshingly generous about spreading credit around to others. He fondly remembers art teachers, tips his hat to fellow directors and mentors Friz Freleng and Tex Avery, and gives the reader a new appreciation of the layout men who create the backgrounds for animated features. Most engaging are Jones's accounts of office life at Warner Brothers, which sounds like just as much fun as you hope it would be. Jones recounts stories of drawing tables wired to wake up sleeping animators when the boss approached and Cal Howard, a gag writer who ran an illegal commissary out of his metal-lined desk. The book is filled with sketches and color plates of much-loved moments from Warner Brothers cartoons and even includes a quick Road Runner and Coyote scene that comes to life when the pages are flipped. Highly recommended for kids who like to draw and adults who have not lost their appreciation for Looney Toons. <i>--Ali Davis</i>The illustrated classic, complete with a new preface by Matt Groening and foreword by Steven Spielberg. <p>Winner of three Academy Awards and numerous other prizes for his animated films, Chuck Jones is the director of scores of Warner Bros.' most famous cartoons and the creator of such beloved characters as the Road Runner, Wile E.

It is written to help you understand your prof&#x2019;s final exam questions &#x2013; to get you through a 3 or 4 hour exam.

Stout shows how shareholder value thinking endangers not only investors but the rest of us as well, leading managers to focus myopically on short-term earnings; discouraging investment and innovation; harming employees, customers, and communities; and causing companies to indulge in reckless, sociopathic, and irresponsible behaviors. And she looks at new models of corporate purpose that better serve the needs of investors, corporations, and society.</p><p>Lynn Stout is the Distinguished Professor of Corporate and Business Law, Clarke Business Law Institute, at Cornell Law School.

On the night of April 20, 2010, the Deepwater Horizon was working in the Gulf of Mexico, finishing an exploratory well named Macondo for the corporation BP. Suddenly the rig was rocked by a loud explosion. Within minutes the Deepwater Horizon was transformed into a column of fire that burned for nearly two days before collapsing into the depths of the Gulf of Mexico. Meanwhile, the Macondo well began vomiting tens of thousands of barrels of oil daily from beneath the sea floor into the Gulf waters. By the time the well was capped in September 2010, the Macondo well blowout was estimated to have caused the largest offshore oil spill in history.1<br><br> The Deepwater Horizon disaster was tragedy on an epic scale, not only for the rig and the eleven people who died on it, but also for the corporation BP. By June of 2010, BP had suspended paying its regular dividends, and BP common stock (trading around $60 before the spill) had plunged to less than $30 per share. The result was a decline in BP&#x2019;s total stock market value amounting to nearly $100 billion. BP&#x2019;s shareholders were not the only ones to suffer. The value of BP bonds tanked as BP&#x2019;s credit rating was cut from a prestigious AA to the near-junk status BBB. Other oil companies working in the Gulf were idled, along with BP, due to a government-imposed moratorium on further deepwater drilling in the Gulf. Business owners and workers in the Gulf fishing and tourism industries struggled to make a living. Finally, the Gulf ecosystem itself suffered enormous damage, the full extent of which remains unknown today.<br><br> After months of investigation, the National Commission on the BP Deepwater Horizon Oil Spill and Offshore Drilling concluded the Macondo blowout could be traced to multiple decisions by BP employees and contractors to ignore standard safety procedures in the attempt to cut costs. (At the time of the blowout, the Macondo project was more than a month behind schedule and almost $60 million over budget, with each day of delay costing an estimated $1 million.)2 Nor was this the first time BP had sacrificed safety to save time and money. The Commission concluded, &#x201c;BP&#x2019;s safety lapses have been chronic.&#x201d;3<br><br> The Ideology of Shareholder Value<br><br> Why would a sophisticated international corporation make such an enormous and costly mistake? In trying to save $1 million a day by skimping on safety procedures at the Macondo well, BP cost its shareholders alone a hundred thousand times more, nearly $100 billion. Even if following proper safety procedures had delayed the development of the Macondo well for a full year, BP would have done much better. The gamble was foolish, even from BP&#x2019;s perspective.<br><br> This book argues that the Deepwater Horizon disaster is only one example of a larger problem that afflicts many public corporations today. That problem might be called shareholder value thinking. According to the doctrine of shareholder value, public corporations &#x201c;belong&#x201d; to their shareholders, and they exist for one purpose only, to maximize shareholders&#x2019; wealth. Shareholder wealth, in turn, is typically measured by share price&#x2014;meaning share price today, not share price next year or next decade.<br><br> Shareholder value thinking is endemic in the business world today. Fifty years ago, if you had asked the directors or CEO of a large public company what the company&#x2019;s purpose was, you might have been told the corporation had many purposes: to provide equity investors with solid returns, but also to build great products, to provide decent livelihoods for employees, and to contribute to the community and the nation. Today, you are likely to be told the company has but one purpose, to maximize its shareholders&#x2019; wealth. This sort of thinking drives directors and executives to run public firms like BP with a relentless focus on raising stock price. In the quest to &#x201c;unlock shareholder value&#x201d; they sell key assets, fire loyal employees, and ruthlessly squeeze the workforce that remains; cut back on product support, customer assistance, and research and development; delay replacing outworn, outmoded, and unsafe equipment; shower CEOs with stock options and expensive pay packages to &#x201c;incentivize&#x201d; them; drain cash reserves to pay large dividends and repurchase company shares, leveraging firms until they teeter on the brink of insolvency; and lobby regulators and Congress to change the law so they can chase short-term profits speculating in credit default swaps and other high-risk financial derivatives. They do these things even though many individual directors and executives feel uneasy about such strategies, intuiting that a single-minded focus on share price may not serve the interests of society, the company, or shareholders themselves.<br><br> This book examines and challenges the doctrine of shareholder value. It argues that shareholder value ideology is just that&#x2014;an ideology, not a legal requirement or a practical necessity of modern business life. United States corporate law does not, and never has, required directors of public corporations to maximize either share price or shareholder wealth. To the contrary, as long as boards do not use their power to enrich themselves, the law gives them a wide range of discretion to run public corporations with other goals in mind, including growing the firm, creating quality products, protecting employees, and serving the public interest. Chasing shareholder value is a managerial choice, not a legal requirement.<br><br> Nevertheless, by the 1990s, the idea that corporations should serve only shareholder wealth as reflected in stock price came to dominate other theories of corporate purpose. Executives, journalists, and business school professors alike embraced the need to maximize shareholder value with near-religious fervor. Legal scholars argued that corporate managers ought to focus only on maximizing the shareholders&#x2019; interest in the firm, an approach they somewhat misleadingly called &#x201c;shareholder primacy.&#x201d; (&#x201c;Shareholder absolutism&#x201d; or &#x201c;shareholder dictatorship&#x201d; would be more accurate.)<br><br> It should be noted that a handful of scholars and activists continued to argue for &#x201c;stakeholder&#x201d; visions of corporate purpose that gave corporate managers breathing room to consider the interests of employees, creditors, and customers. A small number of others advocated for &#x201c;corporate social responsibility&#x201d; to ensure that public companies indeed served the public interest writ large. But by the turn of the millennium, such alternative views of good corporate governance had been reduced to the status of easily ignored minority reports. Business and policy elites in the United States and much of the rest of the world as well accepted as a truth that should not be questioned that corporations exist to maximize shareholder value.4<br><br> Time for Some Questions<br><br> Today, questions seem called for. It should be apparent to anyone who reads the newspapers that Corporate America&#x2019;s mass embrace of shareholder value thinking has not translated into better corporate or economic performance. The past dozen years have seen a daisy chain of costly corporate disasters, from massive frauds at Enron, HealthSouth, and Worldcom in the early 2000s, to the near-failure and subsequent costly taxpayer bailout of many of our largest financial institutions in 2008, to the BP oil spill in 2010. Stock market returns have been miserable, raising the question of how aging baby boomers who trusted in stocks for their retirement will be able to support themselves in their golden years. The population of publicly held U.S. companies is shrinking rapidly as formerly public companies like Dunkin&#x2019; Donuts and Toys&#x201c;R&#x201d; Us &#x201c;go private&#x201d; to escape the pressures of shareholder-primacy thinking, and new enterprises decide not to sell shares to outside investors at all. (Between 1997 and 2008, the number of companies listed on U.S. exchanges declined from 8,823 to only 5,401.)5 Some experts worry America&#x2019;s public corporations are losing their innovative edge.6 The National Commission found that an underlying cause of the Deepwater Horizon disaster was the fact that the oil and gas industry has cut back significantly on research in recent decades, with the result that &#x201c;knowledge and experience within the industry may be decreasing.&#x201d;7<br><br> Even former champions of shareholder primacy are beginning to rethink the wisdom of chasing shareholder value. Iconic CEO Jack Welch, who ran GE with an iron fist from 1981 until his retirement in 2001, was one of the earliest, most vocal, and most influential adopters of the shareholder value mantra. During his first five years at GE&#x2019;s helm, &#x201c;Neutron Jack&#x201d; cut the number of GE employees by more than a third. He also eliminated most of GE&#x2019;s basic research programs. But several years after retiring from GE with more than $700 million in estimated personal wealth, Welch observed in a Financial Times interview about the 2008 financial crisis that &#x201c;strictly speaking, shareholder value is the dumbest idea in the world.&#x201d;8<br><br> It&#x2019;s time to reexamine the wisdom of shareholder value thinking. In particular, it&#x2019;s time to consider how the endless quest to raise share price hurts not only non-shareholder stakeholders and society but also&#x2014;and especially&#x2014;shareholders themselves.<br><br> Revisiting the Idea of &#x201c;Shareholder Value&#x201d;<br><br> Although shareholder-primacy ideology still dominates business and academic circles today, for as long as there have been public corporations there have been those who argue they should serve the public interest, not shareholders&#x2019; alone. I am highly sympathetic to this view. I also believe, however, that one does not need to embrace either a stakeholder-oriented model of the firm, or a form of corporate social responsibility theory, to conclude that shareholder value thinking is destructive. The gap between shareholder-primacy ideology as it is practiced today, and stakeholders&#x2019; and the public interest, is not only vast but much wider than it either must or should be. If we stop to examine the reality of who &#x201c;the shareholder&#x201d; really is&#x2014;not an abstract creature obsessed with the single goal of raising the share price of a single firm today, but real human beings with the capacity to think for the future and to make binding commitments, with a wide range of investments and interests beyond the shares they happen to hold in any single firm, and with consciences that make most of them concerned, at least a bit, about the fates of others, future generations, and the planet&#x2014;it soon becomes apparent that conventional shareholder primacy harms not only stakeholders and the public, but most shareholders as well. If we really want corporations to serve the interests of the diverse human beings who ultimately own their shares either directly or through institutions like pension and mutual funds, we need to seriously reexamine our ideas about who shareholders are and what they truly value.<br><br> This book shows how the project of reexamining shareholder value thinking is already underway. While the notion that managers should seek to maximize share price remains conventional wisdom in many business circles and in the press, corporate theorists increasingly challenge conventional wisdom. New scholarly articles questioning the effects of shareholder-primacy thinking and the wisdom of chasing shareholder value seem to appear daily. Even more important, influential economic and legal experts are proposing alternative theories of the legal structure and economic purpose of public corporations that show how a relentless focus on raising the share price of individual firms may be not only misguided, but harmful to investors.<br><br> These new theories promise to advance our understanding of corporate purpose far beyond the old, stale &#x201c;shareholders-versus-stakeholders&#x201d; and &#x201c;shareholders-versus-society&#x201d; debates. By revealing how a singled-minded focus on share price endangers many shareholders themselves, they also demonstrate how the perceived gap between the interests of shareholders as a class and those of stakeholders and the broader society in fact may be far narrower than commonly understood. In the process, they also offer better, more sophisticated, and more useful understandings of the role of public corporations and of good corporate governance that can help business leaders, lawmakers, and investors alike ensure that public corporations reach their full economic potential.<br><br> The Structure of This Book<br><br> This book offers a guide to the new thinking on shareholder value and corporate purpose. Part I, Debunking the Shareholder Value Myth, discusses the intellectual origins of conventional shareholder-primacy thinking. It shows how the ideology of shareholder value maximization lacks solid grounding in corporate law, corporate economics, or the empirical evidence. Contrary to what many believe, U.S. corporate law does not impose any enforceable legal duty on corporate directors or executives to maximize profits or share price. The philosophical case for shareholder value maximization similarly rests on incorrect factual claims about the economic structure of corporations, including the mistaken claims that shareholders &#x201c;own&#x201d; corporations, that they have the only residual claim on the firm&#x2019;s profits, and that they are &#x201c;principals&#x201d; who hire and control directors to act as their &#x201c;agents.&#x201d; Finally, although researchers have searched diligently, there is a remarkable lack of persuasive empirical evidence to demonstrate that either corporations, or economies, that are run according to the principles of shareholder value perform better over time than those that are not. Put simply, shareholder value ideology is based on wishful thinking, not reality. As a theory of corporate purpose, it is poised for intellectual collapse.<br><br> Part II, What Do Shareholders Really Value?, surveys several promising new alternative theories of the public corporation being offered by today&#x2019;s experts in law, business, and economics. These new theories have two interesting and important elements in common.<br><br> First, as noted earlier, most historical challenges to shareholder primacy have focused on the fear that what is good for shareholders might be bad for other corporate stakeholders (customers, employees, creditors) or for the larger society. The new theories, however, focus on the possibility that shareholder value thinking can harm many shareholders themselves. Indeed, if we think of shareholders as an interest group that persists over time, shareholder value thinking maybe contrary to shareholders&#x2019; own collective interests.<br><br> Second, the new theories raise this counterintuitive possibility by showing how &#x201c;the shareholder&#x201d; is an artificial and highly misleading construct. Most economic interests in stocks are ultimately held by human beings, either directly or indirectly through pension funds and mutual funds. Where &#x201c;shareholders&#x201d; are homogeneous, people are diverse. Some plan to own their stock for short periods, and care only about today&#x2019;s stock price. Others expect to hold their shares for decades, and worry about the company&#x2019;s long-term future. Investors buying shares in new ventures want their companies to be able to make commitments that attract the loyalty of customers and employees. Investors who buy shares later may want the company to try to profit from reneging on those commitments. Some investors are highly diversified and worry how the company&#x2019;s actions will affect the value of their other investments and interests. Others are undiversified and unconcerned. Finally, many people are &#x201c;prosocial,&#x201d; meaning they are willing ...</p><h2>Why Europe?

But the central issues it examines are humor, transgression, and the critical and constructive potential of laughter in the work of a new generation of Bad Girls. Humor is the connecting force between the 45 artists in "Bad Girls," and it is clear that they express themselves in ways that their mothers probably would not have approved of. But they don't care. Bad Girls addresses questions of gender, race, class, age, and sex by challenging conventional ideas about motherhood, food, fashion, beauty, work, marriage, and psychoanalysis. Using humor as a subversive weapon and having a field day with cosmetic aids and transgressive bodies, the artists in Bad Girls draw from the issues that concern artists like Barbara Kruger, Jenny Holzer, Hannah Wilke, and Cindy Sherman while taking these in new directions. In one of the book's four essays, Marcia Tucker, founder and director of The New Museum of Contemporary Art, discusses the relationship between work centering on gender and feminist issues and the carnivalesque, the female/lesbian/cross-dressed body in relation to the "grotesque body," mass culture and popular culture, and the evolution of a female comic sensibility. Marcia Tanner, independent curator for "Bad Girls West" in Los Angeles, focuses on foremothers who include Yoko Ono, Sherrie Levine, and Louise Bougeoise. Linda Goode Bryant, freelance writer and researcher, takes on the etymology of the world "bad" in black culture. And Cheryl Dunye, curator, lecturer, and self-described black lesbian bad girl filmmaker, addreses transgressive women's videos.

But before you shrink in fear from these furry &#x201c;creatures of the night,&#x201d; consider the bat&#x2019;s fundamental role in our ecosystem. A single brown bat can eat several thousand insects in a night. Bats also pollinate and disperse the seeds for many of the plants we love, from bananas to mangoes and figs.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><i>Bats: A World of Science and Mystery </i>presents these fascinating nocturnal creatures in a new light. Lush, full-color photographs portray bats in flight, feeding, and mating in views that show them in exceptional detail. The photos also take the reader into the roosts of bats, from caves and mines to the tents some bats build out of leaves. A comprehensive guide to what scientists know about the world of bats, the book begins with a look at bats&#x2019; origins and evolution. The book goes on to address a host of questions related to flight, diet, habitat, reproduction, and social structure: Why do some bats live alone and others in large colonies? When do bats reproduce and care for their young? How has the ability to fly&#x2015;unique among mammals&#x2015;influenced bats&#x2019; mating behavior? A chapter on biosonar, or echolocation, takes readers through the system of high-pitched calls bats emit to navigate and catch prey. More than half of the world&#x2019;s bat species are either in decline or already considered endangered, and the book concludes with suggestions for what we can do to protect these species for future generations to benefit from and enjoy.<br><br> From the tiny &#x201c;bumblebee bat&#x201d;&#x2015;the world&#x2019;s smallest mammal&#x2015;to the Giant Golden-Crowned Flying Fox, whose wingspan exceeds five feet, <i>A Battery of Bats</i> presents a panoramic view of one of the world&#x2019;s most fascinating yet least-understood species.</p><p><b>Melville Brock Fenton</b> is professor in and chair of the Department of Biology at the University of Western Ontario.

While on the road, a female truck driver and a dog are passed by many other vehicles loaded with various animals. As their journey advances so do the math problems, going from the simple "3 + 2 = 5" to the final "9 + 0 = 9." However, there is no logical progression in the examples provided; why does "6 + 1 = 7" follow "3 + 2 = 5?" The text is told in rhyme, which adds to the sense of movement but it is rather singsong. All of the characters end up at a carousel (made from the drivers' freight) and the final illustrations capture their joy and excitement. The book ends with a two-page spread of suggested activities for kids and adults. The "Level 2" designation suggests that this is designed for ages 6 and up but the simplicity of the story and rhyme as well as the juvenile nature of the illustrations would be more appealing to a younger audience.<br><i>Edith Ching, St. Albans School, Mt.

One result of this instability was that many religious practices moved from the church to the home, and the retablo art form--sacred paintings on tin--flourished.</p><p>With over 1,700 objects, New Mexico State University holds the largest collection of retablos of any museum in the United States. Eleven eminent Latin Americanists from the U.S. and Mexico have studied this collection and placed it in a broad cultural context. They have looked at the retablos from the standpoint of art history, history, anthropology, folk art, and religion to bring a new understanding of and appreciation for these paintings. This interdisciplinary approach brings together multiple influences in considering, for example, Baroque images as popular icons, Aztec gods and home altars, popular images in nineteenth-century Mexico, European and viceregal paintings, and bultos and santos from New Mexico. The richly varied retablo tradition continues to the present, making this volume a much-needed addition to the literature on the complex society that formed along the Camino Real between Mexico City and Santa Fe.</p><p>In addition to the essays, the book includes restoration philosophy and conservation methods, a glossary, chronology, maps, and a comprehensive section on the art and iconography of each object in the Art Gallery collection.</p></p><p>Studies retablos, sacred paintings on tin, from the standpoint of art history, history, anthropology, folk art, and religion to bring a new understanding and appreciation.Elizabeth Netto Calil Zarur teaches art history at New Mexico State University.<br><br>Charles Muir Lovell is director of the Art Gallery at New Mexico State University.</p><h2>Introduction to Business Law</h2><p>Discover the business law text you&#39;ll actually enjoy reading.

These bloody events echoed an older political rift in Egypt and the Middle East: the splitting of nationalists and Islamists during the rule of Egyptian president and Arab nationalist leader Gamal Abdel Nasser. In <i>Making the Arab World</i>, Fawaz Gerges, one of the world&#x2019;s leading authorities on the Middle East, tells how the clash between pan-Arab nationalism and pan-Islamism has shaped the history of the region from the 1920s to the present.</p><p>Gerges tells this story through an unprecedented dual biography of Nasser and another of the twentieth-century Arab world&#x2019;s most influential figures&#x2015;Sayyid Qutb, a leading member of the Muslim Brotherhood and the father of many branches of radical political Islam. Their deeply intertwined lives embody and dramatize the divide between Arabism and Islamism. Yet, as Gerges shows, beyond the ideological and existential rhetoric, this is a struggle over the state, its role, and its power.</p><p>Based on a decade of research, including in-depth interviews with many leading figures in the story, <i>Making the Arab World</i> is essential reading for anyone who wants to understand the roots of the turmoil engulfing the Middle East, from civil wars to the rise of Al-Qaeda and ISIS.</p></p><p><p>"The modern history of Egypt and the Middle East has been profoundly shaped by the interaction between two deeply rooted forces--nationalism and political Islam. Focusing on two outsize personalities who personified these currents, Gamal Abdel Nasser and Sayyid Qutb, and drawing on a decade of research, including many interviews, Fawaz Gerges shows the complex, not always antagonistic, relationship between these powerful and enduring political realities."<b>--William B. Quandt, author of <i>Peace Process: American Diplomacy and the Arab-Israeli Conflict since 1967</i></b></p><p>"Fawaz Gerges is our most perceptive and level-headed analyst of the rise of Muslim extremism. In a field strewn with glib generalizations and sometimes colored by mere bigotry, he insists on giving us context and concentrating on specifics, which he presents in a lively and engaging style. Here he steps back to reveal the full sweep of a key conflict fought throughout the Middle East over the past seventy years between a secular-leaning, authoritarian nationalism and a theocratic irredentism. This is an essential book."<b>--Juan Cole, author of <i>The New Arabs: How the Millennial Generation Is Changing the Middle East</i></b></p><p>"Drawing on decades of interviews, Fawaz Gerges gives us a novel, nuanced, and revealing picture of the relationship between the Egyptian nationalist hero Gamal Abdel Nasser and his one-time ally and ultimate nemesis in the Muslim Brotherhood, Sayyid Qutb. The book offers a fresh interpretation of the modern histories of both the Arab nationalist and Islamist movements--one that will profoundly reshape conventional wisdom about politics in the Arab world."<b>--Lisa Anderson, former president of the American University in Cairo</b></p><p>"A superb work of original scholarship that feeds into a gripping narrative on the fault line between Arab nationalists and Islamists that shaped the modern history of the Middle East. For anyone who wants to make sense of the tangled politics of the region today, there is no better guide."<b>--Avi Shlaim, author of <i>The Iron Wall: Israel and the Arab World</i></b></p><p>"A major achievement, this impeccably researched book contributes significantly to our understanding of Arab and Islamic politics, supplementing and correcting much of it."<b>--James Piscatori, Australian National University</b></p><p>"<i>Making the Arab World</i> is distinctive not only in its much-needed focus on the interaction between Nasserism and Egyptian Islamism, but also in the degree to which the author had access to the views of people who were and are directly involved in the events."<b>--John Voll, author of <i>Islam: Continuity and Change in the Modern World</i></b></p><b>Fawaz A.

All you need to do is develop and hone the skills that will help the leader in you to surface and shine.<br><br>Leaders are not only born, they can also be created. Even if you have never held a leadership position and were told that you did not have &#x201c;leadership potential&#x201d; as you were growing up, you can learn what it takes to be a leader right now. Like math, science, and languages, leadership can be learned because it requires skill sets that can be taught. And since you are clearly capable of learning, the path to leadership is one you can always pursue.<br><br>However, along the path to leadership success, you will have to refuse to give in to negative thinking that can hold you back. Too often brilliant and beautiful young women of color sabotage themselves, sometimes without even knowing that they are doing it, so that they never become the leaders they are capable of becoming or achieve the level of leadership success they deserve. The most critical aspect of leadership is self-esteem, which must flow from the core of your being.<br><br>In order to become a leader and remain an effective one, you must always consider yourself a Very Important Person (VIP). This doesn&#x2019;t mean that you should be arrogant or cocky and walk into your job believing that you already know everything you need to know. Instead, it means that you need to feel confident that you are bringing much value to any workplace and that your cultural strengths, values, and work ethic will stand you in good stead as you go about learning how to do your job, and that you will be successful despite any challenges you may face, whether they are small or large.<br><br>How you feel about yourself is imperative to moving forward and sustaining your efforts to meet your leadership goals. Feeling that you&#x2019;re a VIP, reminding yourself that you&#x2019;re a VIP, dressing like you&#x2019;re a VIP, and acting like you&#x2019;re a VIP (within reason, of course) will help to give you the confidence you need to conquer real and imagined obstacles in your workplace. Rest assured that you can overcome any hurdles you may encounter on your way to becoming a leader &#x2014;just be prepared and hang on to your hat. External&#x2014;and maybe even internal&#x2014;forces will surely test you.<br><br>Because we live in a society where people of color and women are not always valued, some of us consciously or subconsciously transfer the notion that we are not valuable to beliefs of inferiority or inadequacy about ourselves.* A recent Harvard University study identified two kinds of prejudice: individual and systemic. The first kind of prejudice is held by individuals about members of groups other than their own. The second is a set of institutionalized assumptions, attitudes, and practices that have a kind of invisible effect in systematically giving members of more powerful groups certain advantages over members of less dominant groups. So you are not crazy, and you are not alone in feeling that some things are not right or fair in our society. Despite all of the progress women and people of color have made, there are still obstacles in many workplaces. Therefore, you must be ready.<br><br>The first step to handling any sense of unfairness in the business environment is to accept that prejudices of all kinds exist. Indeed, many of us are prejudiced, and instead of letting these feelings get in your way, you must find creative ways to move around them. You may feel frustrated at times, not knowing how to get ahead or what steps you should take to advance. You&#x2019;re not alone. Don&#x2019;t be discouraged. Instead, concentrate on working hard, working smart, and gaining the knowledge you need to move forward. By remaining focused, you will continue to make progress.<br><br>Your ability to remain motivated and continue to believe in yourself as you travel along your leadership journey is very important. In the sport of working, you will need to learn not to take personally everything that happens to you. You must become a savvy &#x201c;player&#x201d; in the work &#x201c;game.&#x201d; Once you decide to become a leader, you put yourself squarely in the game and you must play. You must also be prepared to win as well as suffer some losses along the way. Often those wins and losses will yield critical lessons that will help you mold your own unique leadership style that will make you stand out and move up. Be prepared for the rules of the game to change, sometimes midplay, sometimes completely. Make it your responsibility to keep up with what is going on. Plan to put your own special imprint on your workplace by bringing the very best you have to the table every day. Always hold your head high and remember that you are a VIP, no matter what position you currently hold. You&#x2019;re already on your way to leadership success!<br><br><i>Cultural Code</i><br><br>Given our country&#x2019;s history of legalized slavery, indentured servitude, and the treatment of women as chattel and children as possessions, we should not be surprised if occasionally some of us buy into notions that we are not worthy, that we are undeserving, that we are second best. As a subculture within a dominant culture, we may see more negative than positive reflections of ourselves being portrayed in the media. And in the workplace we may see other employees who don&#x2019;t look like us advance more rapidly than we do (and sometimes they don&#x2019;t have half the credentials and experience that we have) and we may wonder why.<br><br>While there are nearly always things we could do differently or better in our jobs, we all know or have heard of situations where other workers we may have welcomed to the company and trained have received promotions instead of us or much sooner than we do, or co-workers who have gone overbudget on their projects while we have stayed within our budgets, yet they have been promoted and we have remained in our positions. We have met &#x201c;hotshots&#x201d; who seem destined to shoot to the top of the department or company no matter what they do or how many failures they produce. This process is often referred to as &#x201c;failing up.&#x201d;<br><br>These experiences can be discouraging, but they can also be motivating. We must learn that everything we are going through is all a part of the game&#x2014;surviving and thriving in the workplace&#x2014;and the sooner we face this reality the better we will be able to compete in the leadership arena. We must keep our confidence intact and realize that outer forces have nothing to do with our inner spirit&#x2014;our resilience&#x2014;that we inherited from our MAMAs and others. We stand on the shoulders of our ancestors, who sacrificed mightily so that we could have the privileges and opportunities we take for granted today. Through them we know and affirm that we are amazing women, and with confidence in ourselves, we can do anything!<br><br>h MAMAisms<br><br>m Nothing worth having comes easy.<br><br>m You have to work twice as hard as everyone else to get anywhere.<br><br>m You are worthy and deserving of having the best of everything.<br><br>m Make yourself number one.<br><br>m If you don&#x2019;t take care of you first, no one else will.<br><br><i>Chapter Two<br>To Attain Victory, Stay Positive</i><br><br>Master the art of positive thinking. To become a leader you must have a positive mental attitude, which you can achieve with positive self- talk and looking at what is right with people instead of what is wrong with them. Positive self-talk means saying positive things about yourself to yourself and to others. You are what you think, and you can accomplish what you think you can. For example, if you tell yourself that you can&#x2019;t perform a particular task or difficult assignment, then you are setting yourself up for failure. You must tell yourself that you can meet professional challenges that come your way. Instead of thinking, &#x201c;Oh, I can&#x2019;t do this. I&#x2019;ve never done this before,&#x201d; say, &#x201c;This is new to me. I&#x2019;ll give it my best shot.&#x201d; Then go do your homework, consult with others, go online, request the reports, do whatever you need to do to get the information to complete the assignment to the best of your ability. Positive thoughts create constructive energy around you.<br><br>You must establish this habit of positive self-talk in your mind, because it requires regular reinforcement. Make it a habit. Invest five minutes a day before you head out to work. Tell yourself you can meet any professional challenges that life has to offer. Write down your positive affirmations in your Personal Leadership Notebook and read them out loud, or write a positive prayer. The spoken word is extremely powerful.<br><br>For example:<br><br>� I release the past and now allow myself to be filled with positive thoughts.<br><br>� I deserve the best and welcome it into my life.<br><br>� I see the good in everyone.<br><br>� I accept for myself all the good things that life and work have to offer.<br><br>� I am worthy and deserving of new challenges that come my way.<br><br>� I am in the process of making positive changes.<br><br>Be actively aware of what you&#x2019;re thinking. What kind of voice do you hear in your head? Does a voice tell you that you can&#x2019;t do something because a family member warned years ago that you were going to fail? Or that trying something new was too risky? Or that traveling abroad or to other parts of the country is dangerous? If you begin to see a pattern of negative thoughts, write them down and then create positive affirmations to cancel them. You must reprogram your thoughts. It&#x2019;s the only way good things are going to come to you in life. You can make it a good day or a bad day by controlling your thought process. Even if something bad happens to you during the day, you can decide how to react to the situation. Your reaction is your choice and your choice determines how you will respond&#x2014;positive or negative. Create positive images, statements, situations, outcomes, interactions, and exchanges. You can change your life if you change your thinking.<br><br>Having a sense of humor also comes in handy and can help you with your positive attitude. There will be times when you&#x2019;ll just have to throw up your hands and laugh.<br><br>Negative self-talk can lower your expectations, and do damage to your self-confidence and leadership ability. People want to follow leaders who are positive. One of a leader&#x2019;s most important jobs is to set a positive tone.<br><br>People who are positive tend to be:<br><br>� More productive at work.<br><br>� More likely to be noticed and recognized by their boss.<br><br>� More likely to attract co-workers to them.<br><br>� More likely to be open to new experiences.<br><br>� More likely to recognize opportunity when it comes their way.<br><br><i>Cultural Code</i><br><br>We haven&#x2019;t always been exposed to positive images in life, whether due to the media or the racial divide. Not everyone was raised by supportive or well-educated or instructive parents. We haven&#x2019;t always been around positive family and friends. While growing up, some of us didn&#x2019;t receive the attention and encouragement we deserved in classrooms from teachers. While our parents were sometimes struggling to make ends meet, or being challenged by more obstacles than we experience today, we haven&#x2019;t always had the most positive view of the world. Unfortunately, we can even be negative about ourselves. Sometimes we assume that the challenges we are facing have been set before us because we are Black or women. While this may or may not be true, we may become paralyzed with anger or fear because of our own beliefs. We can get in our own way by deciding that &#x201c;they&#x2019;re out to get me,&#x201d; or &#x201c;they just don&#x2019;t understand or value me,&#x201d; and that nothing can be done about it. Look beyond skin color and don&#x2019;t focus on it. We cannot let differences, or what others think or feel, get in the way of achieving our leadership goals. Despite the negative forces around us or inside us, we must overcome them as we embark upon this journey. We have to be positive and view the world in a positive light. For not to be positive would be to give up all hope. We are a strong and spiritual people. We have survived through the ages with physical strength and the strength of our minds. Negative thinking that creates negative emotions can lead to stress, anger, and hostility, as well as disease. So keep your thinking positive.<br><br>Write a list of your good qualities and assets in your PLN. Place positive messages to yourself around your home, tape them to your dresser and medicine cabinet mirrors. Read them out loud and often. Carry them with you in your purse and keep them in your desk drawer at the office and refer to them as a reminder whenever necessary. Refresh or update these positive messages or affirmations to yourself on an as- needed basis. Even if you&#x2019;ve been in your position for years, look at today as if it&#x2019;s your first day on the job and immerse yourself in positive thinking.<br><br>h MAMAisms<br><br>m There&#x2019;s nothing in the world you can&#x2019;t do once you put your mind to it.<br><br>m Always take the high road.<br><br>m Stay on course and expect to be successful.<br><br>m Positive energy yields a positive attitude.<br><br>m Hold your head up high.<br><br><i>Chapter Three<br></i><br><br>Racism Is No Excuse, but It Can Be a Motivator<br><br>As a Black women in America, you will be confronted by or exposed to racism, but instead of getting angry, letting it defeat you, get the best of you, keep you down, prevent you from growing, exploring, realizing your full potential, and manifesting your dreams, use racism as a motivator to accomplish your goals.<br><br>Allow the racism that exists to move you in a forward direction and make you all the more determined to achieve your goals so that no outside forces throw you off balance and make you lose focus on what it is you set out to achieve. In this case, your objective is to acquire the skill sets necessary to become a good leader, a better leader in the workplace.<br><br>A recent Harvard University study reveals that while most fair-minded managers judge you according to your merits, there are some who judge you according to unconscious stereotypes and attitudes. It&#x2019;s the kind of prejudice that is not overt. It&#x2019;s prejudice that&#x2019;s subconscious and made through associations that are learned early on. Things commonly associated with each other like thunder and lightning, or gray hair and old age, don&#x2019;t always coexist.</p><h2>Training Tenor Voices</h2><p>Performance demands on the tenor exceed those of every other vocal category, often necessitating more vocal stamina and greater dramatic subtlety. Moreover, teaching the several categories of the tenor voice presents teachers of singing with a series of problems not encountered with any other voice type. The tenor voice remains, in short, a mystery to most audiences and teachers alike.<br>Training Tenor Voices presents a unique combination of historical and pedagogical information on how tenors sing. Designed as a practical program for singers, teachers, and voice professionals, the book places emphasis on the special nature of the tenor voice and the proper physiological functioning that leads to the establishment of vocal proficiency. It supplies practical information on instruction for each category of the tenor voice; recommends the kinds of literature to sing and to avoid; and provides an effective system for voice building, including registration factors, techniques for breath coordination, vowel modification ("covering"), resonance balancing, range extension, the development of vocal agility, and maintaining the high tessitura and sostenuto. The book also includes dozens of technical exercises; numerous anatomical illustrations; musical examples; the International Phonetic Alphabet (IPA) symbols; unique spectrographic analyses of such famous tenors as Jussi Bjoerling, Franco Corelli, Placido Domingo and Luciano Pavarotti; a glossary of terms; and a bibliography.</p><p></p><h2>The Scarlet Letter</h2><p><p>Hester Prynne is a beautiful young woman. She is also an outcast. In the eyes of her neighbours she has committed an unforgivable sin. Everyone knows that her little daughter Pearl is the product of an illicit affair but no one knows the identity of Pearl&#x2019;s father. Hester&#x2019;s refusal to name him brings more condemnation upon her. But she stands strong in the face of public scorn, even when she is forced to wear the sign of her shame sewn onto her clothes: the scarlet letter &#x201c;A&#x201d; for &#x201c;Adulteress.&#x201d;<br><br>The story of Hester Prynne&#x2013;found out in adultery, pilloried by her Puritan community, and abandoned, in different ways, by both her partner in sin and her vengeance-seeking husband&#x2013;possesses a reality heightened by Hawthorne&#x2019;s pure human sympathy and his unmixed devotion to his supposedly fallen but fundamentally innocent heroine. <br><br>In its moral force and the beauty of its conciliations, <i>The Scarlet Letter</i> rightly deserves its stature as the first great novel written by an American, the novel that announced an American literature equal to any in the world.</p></p><p>Insight Study Guides are written by experts and cover a range of popular literature, plays and films.

Belize is a tiny nation tucked between Guatemala, Mexico, and the Caribbean Sea. It&#x2019;s firmly attached to Central America but considers itself a Caribbean island, like a chicken that thinks it&#x2019;s a duck. For more than a hundred years Belize was known as British Honduras, one of the most remote outposts of the British Empire, which explains why it&#x2019;s the only Latin American nation to embrace English as its official language.<br><br>It&#x2019;s difficult to overstate the smallness of the place. Imagine a country the size of Massachusetts with the population of Corpus Christi, Texas. Give it an army of seven hundred soldiers and a seat in the United Nations and you start to get an idea of Belize. Centuries ago more than one million Maya populated this part of Central America. Today fewer than three hundred thousand Belizeans spread themselves among the country&#x2019;s river towns and tin-shack villages. Two-thirds of the country is covered by jungle.<br><br>Belize goes unnoticed by the rest of the world, and over the years the country has parlayed its obscurity into an attractive asset. For those shipwrecked on the shoals of life, Belize offers a new beginning. The country teems with adventurous refugees who&#x2019;ve set up shop in the middle of the Central American jungle. British innkeepers, Mennonite farmers, Chinese shopkeepers, Lebanese entrepreneurs, American missionaries, Canadian aid workers, and Dutch scientists live peacefully alongside the nation&#x2019;s longer- established residents, the Garifuna artists, Maya cacao growers, Mestizo plantation managers, and Creole politicians who make up the majority of the country&#x2019;s population. Belize draws the eccentric, the madcap, and the downright mad. In this colorful human menagerie it takes some doing to stand out, but there is one woman who manages to delight, enrage, captivate, frustrate, and inspire her fellow Belizeans more than anyone else. She&#x2019;s the proprietor of the Belize Zoo. Her name is Sharon Matola.<br><br>Sharon shares her office with a three-legged jaguar named Angel. When the screen door bangs, Angel limps up a cleated ramp that connects the jaguar habitat to the office, a plywood shack on stilts. When she sees Sharon, Angel rolls over and stretches like a dog wanting its belly scratched. Sharon will toss Angel a piece of chicken through the wire fence that separates them. The jaguar catches the meat in her jaws with a clop. Visitors to Sharon&#x2019;s office often ask to pet Angel, which Sharon discourages. &#x201c;Never pet a jaguar,&#x201d; she once told me, &#x201c;unless you&#x2019;re willing to feed her your hand.&#x201d;<br><br>Sharon speaks fluent Russian and once worked as a lion tamer for a traveling Mexican circus. She sings to wild jaguars to soothe them. As a young woman she married a dentist and lived in a tidy house in Iowa City. When she grew restless she started hopping freight trains to Florida. She once smuggled a spider monkey across the Mexican border by swimming the Rio Grande with the animal balanced on her head. She&#x2019;s an expert in mycology, the study of fungi, and is considered one of the world&#x2019;s foremost authorities on both the scarlet macaw and the Baird&#x2019;s tapir, a three-toed ungulate with a ridiculous floppy snout. Most of that knowledge she picked up while walking through the Central American jungle carrying little more than a machete.<br><br>Sharon is more at home in the jungle than most of us are in our mother&#x2019;s kitchen. An American by birth, she&#x2019;s spent the past quarter century in the raw tropical landscape of Central America. In the fall of 1982 she left the United States to work as an assistant on a nature documentary being filmed in Belize. At the end of the shoot, the director left her in possession of a jaguar, two macaws, a ten-foot boa constrictor, and seventeen other animals. &#x201c;Once you domesticate wild animals, they can&#x2019;t care for themselves in the wild,&#x201d; Sharon told me. &#x201c;If you turn them out they&#x2019;ll starve.&#x201d; So she painted a sign that said belize zoo and stuck it beside the lonely road that runs from Belize City to the Guatemalan border. People came.<br><br>Today the zoo exhibits 125 individual animals and hosts more than seventy thousand visitors every year&#x2014;more than one-quarter of Belize&#x2019;s entire population. It is the country&#x2019;s most visited tourist attraction and one of the region&#x2019;s most prestigious scientific research stations. Belizean children idolize Sharon Matola. She invites them to the zoo and holds a tarantula in her palm, wraps a boa around her leg, and speaks to April the tapir as her friend. In the eyes of children she lives a magical life, padding through her own zoo like Willy Wonka strolling the chocolate factory floor. Sharon often buzzes through the countryside on a Kawasaki 650 motorcycle, and when children see her coming they jump and wave and shout her name: Zoo Lady!<br><br>I met Sharon in 2002 on a reporting trip to Belize. Ari Hershowitz put me on to her. Hershowitz is a scruffy, bearded guy I met years ago while writing a story about a gray whale nursery in Mexico. A multinational corporation wanted to build a salt factory in a calving lagoon. Hershowitz, an organizer for the Natural Resources Defense Council (NRDC), was one of the people who stopped it. Over the years we kept in touch. One day I called and found him in an expansive mood. He had a new project. An international energy company wanted to build a dam that would flood one of the last great sections of unbroken jungle in Central America. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s a small dam but the damage would be enormous,&#x201d; he said. &#x201c;This river valley is like a cradle of life. It&#x2019;s filled with jaguars, tapirs, scarlet macaws. They&#x2019;d all be wiped out by the dam.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Where&#x2019;s the river?&#x201d; I asked.<br><br>&#x201c;Belize.&#x201d;<br><br>I fumbled for an atlas. &#x201c;Belize?&#x201d; I said, flipping to the index. &#x201c;What part of Belize?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Middle of the country, about ten miles from the Guatemalan border,&#x201d; Hershowitz said. &#x201c;Seriously, you should go check it out. It&#x2019;s a two-hour flight from Houston.&#x201d; He paused. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s a former British colony. Everybody speaks English.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Who&#x2019;s fighting the dam?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;We&#x2019;re working with a coalition of groups down there, but there&#x2019;s one woman who&#x2019;s spearheading things. Her name&#x2019;s Sharon Matola. She&#x2019;s kind of the Doctor Doolittle of Belize.&#x201d;<br><br>I reached for a pen. &#x201c;Any other interesting characters?&#x201d;<br><br>Hershowitz chuckled. &#x201c;How much time you got?&#x201d;<br>Later that week I made a few phone calls to Belize, which is an experience not unlike playing the slots. You dial and dial, and once in a while the call goes through. Everyone I talked to either loved or despised Sharon Matola. &#x201c;She&#x2019;s our Joan of Arc,&#x201d; one woman told me. Another man practically spat when he mentioned &#x201c;that woman.&#x201d; A little online research revealed that the Belizean newspapers were equally divided. Some praised the Zoo Lady and her anti-dam crusade. Others blamed her for all of the nation&#x2019;s ills. Banks wouldn&#x2019;t lend Belize money because of Sharon Matola. Children went hungry because of Sharon Matola. The Belize Times, the Belizean government mouthpiece, called her a modern-day colonialist and a traitor to the nation. A government spokesman labeled her &#x201c;an enemy of the people.&#x201d;<br><br>It was that phrase&#x2014;&#x201c;an enemy of the people&#x201d;&#x2014;more than anything else, I think, that convinced me to fly to Belize and track down the Zoo Lady. Over the next six years I would come to appreciate Sharon Matola in all her complexity. She is a strange and enchanting woman. She can display more tenacity, courage, generosity, and love than seems possible for one person. She can be warm, goofy, and funny. She can also be impossibly stubborn and self-righteous. I didn&#x2019;t know that at the beginning. All I knew was that if any government hated and feared a woman that much, I wanted to meet her.<br>According to the World Conservation Union (IUCN),* the most respected scientific organization tracking species extinction, one in every four mammal species and one in eight bird species face a high risk of extinction in the near future.

The problem has become known as the &#x201c;sixth extinction crisis&#x201d; because it follows previous waves of species disappearance in the Ordovician, Devonian, Permian, Triassic, and Cretaceous periods. Those extinctions happened over geologic time. This one is happening in the blink of an eye.<br><br>At times the earth&#x2019;s fate seems so dire and inexorable that I&#x2019;m tempted to throw up my hands and say to hell with it. The forces driving the sixth extinction possess so much money and power that fighting them requires a willing suspension of disbelief. The odds are so long that if you look at them too hard you&#x2019;ll lose your mind. Every once in a while, though, I meet a rare subspecies of human who offers hope. It&#x2019;s almost never a politician or a scientist. It&#x2019;s almost always a woman without credentials. They&#x2019;re often self-taught researchers who become experts through years of hard experience and close observation. They&#x2019;re the ones who scoop up a jar of brown water from a ditch and ask impertinent questions about what&#x2019;s in it. Because they don&#x2019;t know protocol they barge in and do what nobody else has the courage to do.

The first study focuses on the relationship of reason, the individual, and society in Hegel, defending him against the criticism that he was merely an apologist for bourgeois society. The second study examines the experiential content of Hegel's idealism, considering the notion of experience in relation to immediacy, empirical reality, science, and society. The third study, "Skoteinos," is an unusual and fascinating essay in which Adorno lays out his thoughts on understanding Hegel. In his reflections, which spring from his experience teaching at the Goethe University in Frankfurt, questions of textual and philosophical interpretation are intertwined. Rescuing the truth value of Hegel's work is a recurring theme of the critical theory of the Frankfurt School, and nowhere is this goal pursued with more insight than in these three studies. The core problem Adorno sets for himself is how to read Hegel in a way that comprehends both the work and its historical context, thereby allowing conclusions to be drawn that may seem on the surface to be exactly opposed to what Hegel wrote but that are, nevertheless, valid as the present truth of the work. It is the elaboration of this method of interpretation, a negative dialectic, that was Adorno's underlying goal. Adorno's efforts to salvage the contemporaneity of Hegel's thought form part of his response to the increasingly tight net of social control in the aftermath of World War II. In this, his work is related to the very different attempts to undermine reified thinking undertaken by the various French theorists. The continued development of what Adorno called "the administered world" has only increased the relevance of his efforts.</p></p><p>Theodor W. Adorno (1903-1969) was a student of philosophy, musicology, psychology, and sociology at Frankfurt where he later became Professor of Philosophy and Sociology and Co-Director of the Frankfurt School. During the war years he lived in Oxford, in New York, and in Los Angeles, continuing to produce numerous books on music, literature, and culture.Text: English (translation)<br> Original Language: German</p><h2>Fundamentals of Physics</h2><p>The guide to accompany the fifth edition of this introduction to physics. This text addresses the issue of building &#34;bridges of reason&#34;, so that students may move from qualitative understanding of any given physics concept to making decisions about how to solve a problem involving that concept.</p><p>For four editions, Fundamentals of Physics has successfully prepared physics students for careers in science and engineering. This newest edition expands on the strengths of earlier versions, helping students bridge the gap between concepts and reasoning. Students are shown, rather than told about, how physics works and are given the opportunity to apply concepts to real-world problems. Each chapter and concept has been scrutinized to ensure clarity, currency, and accuracy while checkpoints, problem solving tactics, and sample problems help students make sense of new concepts. As always, Fundamentals of Physics covers every aspect of basic physics, from force and motion to relativity and will prepare today&#39;s students to be tomorrow&#39;s scientists.&nbsp;</p><h2>The Epistles to the Colossians and to Philemon (Cambridge Greek Testament Commentaries)</h2><p>This is a theological commentary on the Greek text; on the foundation of linguistic detail is based a doctrinal exposition. The first section of the Introduction is on the religious ideas of the epistles, and frequent allusion is made throughout the commentary to works on New Testament theology. There are special notes on many of the important theological terms such as &#39;knowledge&#39;, &#39;mystery&#39;, pleroma, as well as on linguistic points, such as the use of the reflexive pronoun. But attention is devoted also to critical and introductory matters, and this is, it is believed, the first commentary on Colossians and Philemon to discuss in some detail the theories of Professors E. J. Goodspeed and J. Knox. The commentary is documented with references to works in English, French and German, for those who wish to follow up the study in greater detail. But the aim has been to make the exposition as far as possible self-contained and intelligible to a reader with no other books before him than the New Testament in Greek and the Old Testament in English.</p><p>Moule is former Lady Margaret&#39;s Professor of Divinity at Cambridge University, a position he held for 25 years.</p><h2>A Practical Introduction to Electronic Circuits</h2><p>The effective learning of electronics must involve practical experience in circuit building.

A native-born Israeli, Rabin became an inextricable part of his nation&#x2019;s pre-state history and subsequent evolution. This revealing account of his life, character, and contributions draws not only on original research but also on the author&#x2019;s recollections as one of Rabin&#x2019;s closest aides.<br> &nbsp;<br> An awkward politician who became a statesman, a soldier who became a peacemaker, Rabin is best remembered for his valiant efforts to resolve the Israeli-Palestinian conflict and for the Oslo Accords. Itamar Rabinovich provides extraordinary new insights into Rabin&#x2019;s relationships with powerful leaders including Bill Clinton, Jordan&#x2019;s King Hussein, and Henry Kissinger, his desire for an Israeli-Syrian peace plan, and the political developments that shaped his tenure. The author also assesses the repercussions of Rabin&#x2019;s murder: Netanyahu&#x2019;s ensuing election and the rise of Israel&#x2019;s radical right wing.</p><p><b>Itamar Rabinovich</b> is president of The Israel Institute (Washington, DC, and Tel Aviv); Global Distinguished Professor, New York University; and Non-Resident Distinguished Fellow, Brookings Institution. He is a former president of Tel Aviv University and was Rabin&#x2019;s ambassador in Washington and chief negotiator with Syria."Mr. Rabinovich, the distinguished Israeli scholar and diplomat . . . easily establishes that the prime minister was a man of great complexity. . . . Even the warm esteem in which he holds Rabin does not prevent Mr. Rabinovich&#x2014;a scholar with an abiding commitment to historical accuracy&#x2014;from presenting a portrait of his friend in full."&#x2014;Elliott Abrams, <i>Wall Street Journal</i><br><p>"Rabinovich&#x2019;s language&#x2014;lean, precise, devoid of embellishment&#x2014;reminds me of the way Rabin himself used to talk: dugri, as we say in Hebrew, straightforward, to the point. . . . In an era when language is being abused for political purposes and agendas, Rabinovich&#x2019;s book is a breath of fresh air."&#x2014;Uri Dromi, <i>Times Literary Supplement</i></p><br>"Puts the complexities of [Rabin's] career and achievement in fresh perspective."&#x2014;<i>Kirkus Reviews</i><br>"This well-written, easily digestible biography also provides useful insights into the inner workings of Israeli politics."&#x2014;<i>Booklist</i><br>"Rabinovich&#x2019;s biography of Rabin is clear and objective. It is the work of a man who has substantial scholarly credentials&#x2014;he currently heads the Israel Institute think tank&#x2014;and who worked with Rabin in his efforts to make peace with Syria. The author describes Rabin&#x2019;s meticulous attention to detail and his insistence on careful planning, which were both the late prime minister&#x2019;s greatest assets and greatest faults. In the end, as this book makes clear, Rabin was not a dreamer but a realist, not a bold thinker but a careful planner, not a charismatic leader but an often intemperate and undiplomatic head of state."&#x2014;Rabbi Jack Reimer, <i>Jewish News Service</i><br>"Rabinovich is a distinguished historian of the Middle East. . . . His book tells a very revealing story that ties the arc of Rabin&#x2019;s life to the course of Israel&#x2019;s history from the pre-State period to the 1990s."&#x2014;Dennis Ross, <i>Jewish Review of Books</i><br>"Rabinovich&#x2019;s book transports readers back to a time when a much different Middle East seemed possible, an all-too-brief window when regional tranquility wasn&#x2019;t a far-off notion or a dark punchline. But Rabinovich&#x2019;s book also makes the important case that nothing was ever as simple or straightforward as it now may seem to have been&#x2014;starting with Rabin himself."&#x2014;Armin Rosen, <i>Tablet</i><br>"Rabinovich has produced an immensely engaging study of Yitzhak Rabin. The subtitle, 'Soldier, Leader, Statesman,' captures the focus of Rabinovich&#x2019;s insightful narrative . . . . It is certainly required reading for anyone interested in Israel and the Middle East today."&#x2014;<i>America Magazine</i><br>"[This] compelling tome adds new layers to the story of one of Israel&#x2019;s most well-known and admired leaders, thanks to original research and unique personal recollections. . . . The author offers new insights into Rabin&#x2019;s relationships with leaders such as Bill Clinton, Henry Kissinger and King Hussein of Jordan, as well as a sophisticated analysis on the repercussions of his murder that echo to this day."&#x2014;<i>St. Louis Jewish Light</i><br>&#x201c;[<i>Yitzhak Rabin</i>] is an excellent starting point for studying Rabin, particularly for readers who are unfamiliar with him or with Israeli political history.&#x201d;&#x2014;Ziv Rubinovitz, <i>Middle East Journal</i><br>"A very readable rendering of Rabin's life."&#x2014;Efraim Inbar,&nbsp;<i>Middle East Quarterly</i><br>"Rabinovich&#x2019;s creditable and workmanlike narrative moves efficiently and often concisely. The context he offers is especially illuminating on the run-up to the 1967 war . . . ; the intricacies of Israeli politics . . . ; and Rabin&#x2019;s hopeful, tragic final years and months."&#x2014;David K. Shipler, <i>Moment</i><br>"One of Israel&#x2019;s finest senior Middle East historians has written this excellent biography."&#x2014;Ken Stein, <i>Israel Studies Review</i><br>&#x201c;One of Israel&#x2019;s finest senior Middle East historians has written this excellent biography. . . . We are treated to key moments in Israel&#x2019;s past when Rabin&#x2019;s decisions left their mark, entwined with Zionism&#x2019;s national evolution during his half-century of public service.&#x201d;&#x2014;Ken Stein, <i>Israel Studies Review</i><br>Winner of the Washington Institute Book Prize Gold Medal for 2017<br>&#x201c;Yitzhak Rabin was a soldier and a statesman who fought for the security of Israel and for a concept of peace for all nations. Itamar Rabinovich has written a thoughtful and extraordinarily comprehensive account of a significant leader.&#x201d;&#x2014;Henry A. Kissinger<br>"Itamar Rabinovich has written an insightful book on Yitzhak Rabin, Israel&#x2019;s charismatic warrior-statesman who valiantly dedicated himself to the cause of peace in the Middle East. As the head of Rabin&#x2019;s team during Syrian-Israeli peace negotiations and as Israel&#x2019;s ambassador in Washington, Rabinovich was at Rabin&#x2019;s side during key moments in his country&#x2019;s history.&nbsp; I recommend his book to all those interested in peace between Arabs and Israelis."&#x2014;James A. Baker, III<br>"This highly informative and tightly-packed biography is undergirded by a deep personal knowledge of Rabin&#x2019;s strengths and flaws as a leader and a sure command of Israel&#x2019;s military and diplomatic history."&#x2014;Derek Penslar, Harvard University and the University of Toronto<br></p><h2>Managerial Accounting: An Introduction to Concepts, Methods and Uses</h2><p>Now you can focus on the concepts, methods, and uses of managerial accounting that will prepare you to become an effective manager in today&#39;s business world.

Foltz masterfully deals with disparate histories from one point of the compass to its seeming opposite, while weaving a wonderfully lucid story of merchants, pilgrims, and missionaries. - The Journal of Asian History "Professor Foltz excels at concise explanations of the development of the many religions scattered throughout the central Asian area of the Silk Road . . . Throughout this excellent book Professor Foltz makes clear the importance of trade and cultural exchanges in the unfolding of history." - Journal of World History "Foltz takes us on an instructive journey through time and space, revealing the fluidity of barriers, geographical and otherwise, on the historical trail and bypaths of the 'Silk Road,' which stretches from China in the East and across Central Asia to the shores of the Mediterranean in the West." - History: Reviews of New Books ". . . an absolute gem . . . well researched and well written, it brings together a huge amount of information in an attractive package." - Jerry H. Bentley, Editor, Journal of World History "This was an extraordinary book when it first came out a decade ago; it is an even more impressive work in its revised second edition.What makes Richard Foltz's Religions of the Silk Road so unusual and valuable is that, despite its concise, compressed form and highly readable style, it is packed with an astonishing wealth of fascinating information based on a judicious combination of primary sources and secondary literature.For someone who wishes to learn about the transmission of religious culture along the Silk Road during the past two millennia - including Zoroastrianism, Buddhism, Manichaeism, Nestorian Christianity, Judaism, and Islam - there can be no more convenient and illuminating guide than this extraordinary volume." - Victor H. Mair, Professor of Chinese Language and Literature, University of Pennsylvania"To read this fascinating book is to journey through time, to ride those intriguing stretches of overland trails from Europe to Asia known collectively as the 'Silk Road.' There strands of Buddhism, Zoroastrianism, Manichaeism, Christianity, Judaism, and Islam all intertwined and sometimes converged, making for a time eastern Central Asia the most multicultural region on the planet. Foltz brings to life this amazing history in an authoritative and engrossing way, and entices us into this wondrous early era of globalized religion." - Mark Juergensmeyer, University of California, Santa Barbara; Editor of the Oxford Handbook of Global Religion; President of the American Academy of Religion". . . an excellent text to use in a course on 'Eastern' religions, or on the historical-social-economic-religious development of that part of the world from the eastern Mediterranean across the Eurasian steppe through to China. . . . Foltz writes with a very deft balance and a very even-handed presentation of many different historical periods, geographical circumscriptions, and religious traditions." - Eastern Christian Books Blog</p></p><h2>Chemistry Workbook For Dummies</h2><p><b>From liquids and solids to acids and bases - work chemistry equations and use formulas with ease</b> <p>Got a grasp on the chemistry terms and concepts you need to know, but get lost halfway through a problem or, worse yet, not know where to begin?

These principles direct human behaviour, and are therefore extremely powerful: reciprocation, consistency, social validation, liking, authority and scarcity.

But when detailing the many things that the poor have not, we often overlook the most critical&#x2014;their health. The poor die sooner. Blacks die sooner. And poor urban blacks die sooner than almost all other Americans. In nearly four decades as a doctor at hospitals serving some of the poorest communities in Chicago, David A. Ansell, MD,&nbsp; has witnessed firsthand the lives behind these devastating statistics. In <i>The Death Gap</i>, he gives a grim survey of these realities, drawn from observations and stories of his patients.<br><br> While the contrasts and disparities among Chicago&#x2019;s communities are particularly stark, the death gap is truly a nationwide epidemic&#x2014;as Ansell shows, there is a thirty-five-year difference in life expectancy between the healthiest and wealthiest and the poorest and sickest American neighborhoods. If you are poor, where you live in America can dictate when you die. It doesn&#x2019;t need to be this way; such divisions are not inevitable. Ansell calls out the social and cultural arguments that have been raised as ways of explaining or excusing these gaps, and he lays bare the structural violence&#x2014;the racism, economic exploitation, and discrimination&#x2014;that is really to blame. Inequality is a disease, Ansell argues, and we need to treat and eradicate it as we would any major illness. To do so, he outlines a vision that will provide the foundation for a healthier nation&#x2014;for all.<br><br> Inequality is all around us, and often the distance between high and low life expectancy can be a matter of just a few blocks. But geography need not be destiny, urges &nbsp;Ansell. In <i>The Death Gap</i> he shows us how we can face this national health crisis head-on and take action against the circumstances that rob people of their dignity and their lives.</p><p><b>David A. Ansell</b>, MD, is the senior vice president and associate provost for community health equity as well as the Michael E. Kelly Professor of Medicine at Rush University Medical Center in Chicago. He is the author of <i>County: Life, Death, and Politics at Chicago&#x2019;s Public Hospital</i>."Compelling. . . . Without providing easy answers, Ansell challenges readers to be aware of health disparities and to work toward equality."<br> &nbsp; (<i>Christian Century</i>)<br><br>"This passionate polemic uses powerful patient stories to highlight the importance of neighbourhood conditions, healthcare inequalities and poverty in explaining the health gap between black and white Americans. Drawing on detailed case studies of racial inequalities in breast cancer mortality, the health consequences of mass imprisonment, immigration status and access to healthcare, the Chicago heatwave and Hurricane Katrina, Ansell vividly unpicks a spider&#x2019;s web of causality. . . .&nbsp;This is a wide-ranging and very important book. Easy to read and engaging, it makes the social determinants come alive." (Clare Bambra <i>Times Higher Education</i>)<br><br>&#x201c;Ansell does a magnificent job of uncovering the myriad ways in which structural racism &#x2014;&nbsp;in housing, employment, education, and health care, for a start&nbsp;&#x2014;&nbsp;creates unacceptable &#x2018;death gaps&#x2019; or disparities in life expectancy that are preventable and therefore morally unacceptable. &nbsp;This moving study delivers the harsh truth about the ways that racism infects our nation&#x2019;s health care system, and it does so with passion and eloquence. &nbsp;One comes away from <i>Death Gap </i>feeling inspired to act, and that&#x2019;s a rare and wonderful accomplishment.&#x201d; (Beryl Satter, author of Family Properties: How the Struggle over Race and Real Estate Transformed Chicago and Urban America)<br><br>&nbsp;&#x201c;<i>The Death Gap</i> describes critical health inequalities in the United States, which are drawn from Ansell&#x2019;s&nbsp; gripping first-person experiences as a leading practitioner operating in Chicago&#x2019;s medical safety net. He reveals the profound inequalities, particularly racial inequalities, that generate tremendous differences in lifespan and well-being across neighborhoods, and he provides powerful patient anecdotes that provide a human face to otherwise abstract challenges.&#x201d;<br><br> &nbsp;<br> &nbsp; (Harold Pollack, University of Chicago)<br><br>"How race and class affect health is demonstrated by a single statistic: Black women are 40 percent more likely to die from breast cancer than white women, though they develop it at the same rate...&nbsp;<i>The Death Gap</i>&nbsp;cites the three B&#x2019;s &#x2013; beliefs, behavior and biology &#x2013; as the wrong explanations for health and life expectancy differences."

Tour.</p><p>Lecturer and Maxwell Maltz-disciple Sommer ( Not Another Diet Book ), writing with freelancer Falstein, here updates and expands the 1960 Maltz classic, Psycho-Cybernetics. Rather than relying on the Freudian approach of yielding control to the subconscious or on "will power" to change behavior, Psycho-Cybernetics (a computer term referring to the mental "steering system" that guides our attitudes, behavior and self-image) directs the intuitive and nonverbal right brain to "reprogram" the logical and verbal left brain through a six-step program that relies heavily on visualizations and affirmations. The steps are: programming your "success mechanism," imagining success, shedding false beliefs, learning to relax, using "drug-free tranquilizers" and setting goals. Through anecdotes, the authors show how people have improved their self-images and have realized their goals using Maltz's program. Self-quizzes are included.

It goes far beyond the "how to" of youth ministry and provides youth ministers, youth works, and parents with the content that students need to equip them for 'life beyond youth group." The material in this book and the companion book <i>The Seven Checkpoints Student Journal </i>reveals what Stanley calls "the irreducible minimum"--the essential principles upon which an entire youth ministry can be built. Stanley and Hall offer some unorthodox but very sensible approaches to planning and maintaining a youth group over a long period of time with a specific goal in mind. The book outlines a strategy for effectively teaching students over the course of their time in school, and this new updated edition is what every leader needs to keep up with the ever-changing challenges students face. Stanley and Hall identify seven "checkpoints" that are the most important and critical issues facing teens: <br><br>1. Authentic Faith <br>2. Spiritual Disciplines <br>3. Moral Boundaries (this section deals primarily with issues of sexual purity and dating) <br>4. Healthy Friendships <br>5. Wise Choices <br>6. Ultimate Authority <br>7.

The poetic stories in <em>DS (2)</em> use Brathwaite's trademark sycorax video style, offering personal revelations mixed with political and historical fables occurring around the globe. Brathwaite's prose poems relate with ardency and pathos the Caribbean experience and are a potent voice of the African diaspora. Nathaniel Mackey wrote: "Kamau Brathwaite's 'calibanic play' reveals a fiendish delight in the slippage to which words are prone." And <em>American Book Review</em> wrote: "In its rhythms as well as its explorations of 'nation language' and of the traces of an African past, this is a populist work." This exciting new offering by Kamau Brathwaite follows on the heels of the publication of Brathwaite's <em>Born to Slow Horses</em>, which won the coveted 2006 Griffin Poetry Prize.</p><p>Kamau Brathwaite was born in Barbados in 1930. Co-founder of the Caribbean Artists Movement, Brathwaite has received numerous awards, including the Neustadt International Prize for Literature, and the Casa de las Americas Prize.

Insights from author Alister E. McGrath</b><br> <table> <tbody><tr> <td></td> </tr> <tr> <td>Author Alister E. McGrath</td> </tr> </tbody></table> <p>There are a number of reasons why it&#x2019;s both important and enriching to study theology and here I have listed what I think are three of the most important. <br><br> Firstly, studying theology is about making sense of some of the great debates and themes of history. It is impossible to study the religious art of the Middle Ages, the great literature of the Renaissance, the history of the sixteenth century, or the novels of J. R. R. Tolkien without knowing something about theology. To study theology is to pass through a gateway which offers an enhanced vision of human thought and history. It&#x2019;s like a lens that helps bring things into focus. <br><br> Secondly, theology enables us to see things through the eyes of others, so that we can gain fresh perspectives on some of the great questions of faith. One of the leading themes of C. S. Lewis&#x2019;s late work An Experiment in Criticism (1961) is that reading literature enables us to see with the eyes of others, deepening and sometimes challenging our own ideas. To read Augustine, Athanasius, Thomas Aquinas or Karl Barth is to have our eyes opened to other ways of seeing things. We may not agree with them, but their insights help us forge and enrich our own approaches.<br><br> Thirdly, studying theology brings new depth and vitality to faith. When the novelist Evelyn Waugh discovered Christianity in 1930, he spoke of beginning the &#x201c;delicious process of exploring it limitlessly.&#x201d; Theology is about mapping the landscape of faith, discovering its landmarks, appreciating its inner logic, and experiencing its beauty and richness.</p> <br> <table> <tbody><tr> <td> <i>The Triumph of Saint Thomas Aquinas</i>, painting by Benozzo de Gozzoli, ca. 1420-97, tempera.

If we continue with current farming practices, vast amounts of wilderness will be lost, millions of birds and billions of insects will die, and the public will lose billions of dollars as a consequence of environmental degradation. Clearly, there must be a better way to meet the need for increased food production.<br> <br> Written as part memoir, part instruction, and part contemplation, <em>Tomorrow's Table</em> argues that a judicious blend of two important strands of agriculture--genetic engineering and organic farming--is key to helping feed the world's growing population in an ecologically balanced manner. Pamela Ronald, a geneticist, and her husband, Raoul Adamchak, an organic farmer, take the reader inside their lives for roughly a year, allowing us to look over their shoulders so that we can see what geneticists and organic farmers actually do. The reader sees the problems that farmers face, trying to provide larger yields without resorting to expensive or environmentally hazardous chemicals, a problem that will loom larger and larger as the century progresses. They learn how organic farmers and geneticists address these problems. <br> <br> This book is for consumers, farmers, and policy decision makers who want to make food choices and policy that will support ecologically responsible farming practices. It is also for anyone who wants accurate information about organic farming, genetic engineering, and their potential impacts on human health and the environment.</p><p><br><strong>Pamela C. Ronald</strong> is a Professor in the Department of Plant Pathology at the University of California, Davis. Her laboratory has genetically engineered rice for resistance to diseases and flooding. Her work has been published in <em>Science</em>, <em>Nature</em>, and other scientific periodicals and has also been featured in newspapers including <em>The New York Times</em>, <em>The Wall Street Journal</em>, and <em>Le Monde</em>. She is an elected Fellow of the American Association for the Advancement of Science.<br><br> <strong>Raoul Adamchak</strong> has grown organic crops for twenty years, part of the time as a partner in Full Belly Farm, a private 150-acre organic vegetable farm. He has inspected over one hundred organic farms as an inspector for California Certified Organic Farmers (CCOF) and served as a member and President of CCOF's Board of Directors. He now works at the U.C., Davis as the Market Garden Coordinator at the certified organic farm on campus.<br><br>-The authors are eminently qualified to present authoritative descriptions of their respective disciplines, which they do in a readable and accurate manner. But the noteworthy aspect of the book is the way they then marry their separate fields to argue logically for the use of GM technologies to improve organic agriculture.

The book separates out clearly the issues of how to make sure new seeds are safe, how to price them and how to treat them as intellectual property. I gained an understanding of the history of organic farming and learned about some of the very clever ways organic farmers control pests.

Grammar with a Giggle for High School (Maupin House)</h2><p>Good grief! Is nothing sacred? Jane Bell Kiester transforms Shakespeare&#39;s Twelfth Night, A Midsummer Night&#39;s Dream, and Much Ado about Nothing into the best way ever to teach grammar, mechanics, vocabulary, and usage to high school students. Easy to adapt to your specific needs, this fun resource gives you three years&#39; worth of sentences, final tests with answer keys, literary devices, daily vocabulary words, lesson plans, a handy grammar reference, and a mix-and-match menu of Elizabethan swear words.

More Grammar with a Giggle.</p><p>Jane Kiester is the author of the popular Caught'ya books: <i>Caught'ya! Grammar with a Giggle; Caught'ya Again! More Grammar with a Giggle; The Chortling Bard!

Grammar with a Giggle for Third Grade</i> (these last three were formerly <i>Elementary, My Dear! Caught'ya! Grammar with a Giggle for Grades 1, 2, and 3</i>), all published by Maupin House. Teachers all over the country also use the new edition of her third book, <i>Blowing Away the State Writing Assessment Test</i>, to help improve their students' scores on state writing assessment tests. Jane's newest book is <i>Teach Spelling So It Sticks! Quick and Clever Ways That Work for Grades 4-8</i>. <p>In addition to writing books, Jane has given hundreds of workshops to fellow teachers around the country for the past ten years. Her subject? The same as in her classroom, where she happily taught elementary or middle school for more than 30 years -- teaching students to write well. </p><p>In her three decades as a classroom teacher, Jane has served many years as various department chairpersons and grade-level chairperson. She is also a past president of the Alachua County Teachers of English. Jane has been recognized three times by "Who's Who Among America's Teachers." In 2002 she won Teacher of the Year for her school and Middle School Teacher of the Year for her county.</p>(From the corrected sentences of Much Ado About Everything. In the book, the uncorrected sentences are blocked out in groups of one to three. The teacher places the uncorrected sentences on the board or an overhead, and the students correct them. The teacher teaches only the skills used in the sentences for that day. Each sentence grouping in the book also has the corrected sentences underneath the uncorrected ones. After correction with the class, the paper is put away until the next day. The story that follows shows the corrected sentences altogether to give you an idea of the entire story line.) <p>This is the story of a battle of the sexes, of two love affairs fraught with obstacles, and of chicanery. It's a romantic comedy set in Messina, Italy, centuries ago when men held all the power, and women were subjugated to their will. The convoluted soap opera of peace battles began at the end of a foiled rebellion. Don Pedro, Prince of Aragon, Spain, had just defeated his amoral half-brother, Don John. The latter had been the malefactor who had started the rebellion. Don Pedro and two of his gallants, Claudio, a stalwart stripling from Florence, Italy, and Benedick of Padua, Italy, were returning home from the war. When they reached Messina, Italy, they were to become the guests of Leonato, the governor of Messina. </p><p>Now Leonato had a comely daughter who was named Hero. Not only was Hero beautiful, but she was dulcet and virtuous as well. In addition his dulcet, virtuous daughter, Leonato also was reading his only niece, the witty Beatrice. She was as caustic as her cousin Hero was dulcet... </p><p>In his spacious and well-appointed living room of his estate, Leonato read the letter to his doting daughter and niece. </p><p>"Is Signior Mountanto returning with him?" asked Beatrice, who was trying to appear nonchalant as she sat on a green, high-backed couch. </p><p>"For whom are you asking, Niece?" queried Leonato amiably. </p><p>"My cousin means Signior Benedick of Padua," Hero said with a wink, a smile, and a pat for Beatrice."...... (The story continues, with enough Caught'ya sentence groupings for one each for four days a week.)</p></p><h2>Dante: A Life in Works</h2><p>The Divine Comedy, completed around 1320, is a supreme work of the imagination. None of Dante's other works, nor even all of his other works taken together, can rival the Comedy. How did the Florentine exile come to create this masterpiece? What steps in his development can explain the making of this extraordinary poem? In this book, a preeminent Dante scholar turns to the poet's body of works&#x2014;the only real biography of Dante that we have&#x2014;to illuminate these questions. Through an exposition of Dante's other writings, Robert Hollander provides a concise intellectual biography of the writer whom many consider the greatest narrative poet of the modern era. <p>Hollander writes for those who have already encountered the Comedy, suggesting to these readers how Dante's other works relate to the great poem and inviting them to reread the Comedy with new interest and understanding.</p></p><p>Robert Hollander is professor of European literature in the Department of Romance Languages and Literatures at Princeton University. He is one of only three Americans ever to receive the gold medal of the city of Florence for their efforts on behalf of DanteMany gaps still exist in the biography of Dante after 700 years; few contemporary documents chart the path of his exile from Florence. Rather than the physical Dante, we are left with the body of his works. While the Commedia and, to a lesser extent, the Vita Nuova overshadow the rest, there remain a number of additional poems, treatises, and letters. Hollander (European literature, Princeton Univ.; Justice and Poetry: Dante's Book of the Dead), one of the leading American Dante scholars, here offers an intellectual biography of the poet. Following the chronology established by Petrocchi, the author constructs Dante's intellectual and aesthetic itinerary through a close reading of his works, attempting to trace his development. Hollander writes with brevity, clarity, and a confidence that comes from his mastery of the vast scholarship and a lifetime of reflection. An important contribution to scholarship, yet readily accessible to the general reader, this is recommended to public and academic libraries. T.L.

Tour. Lit Guild &amp; Doubleday Feat Alt. First serial, The New Yorker. Second serial, Good Housekeeping.</p><p>Reeve Lindbergh's memoir offers a uniquely intimate portrait of her family led by her intensely private father, aviator Charles Lindbergh, and mother, writer Anne Morrow Lindbergh. <i>Under a Wing</i> captures both her parents' complex personalities with immediacy and intimacy. Reeve explores the contrast between a loving father who "would parade imaginary animals across our backs" and the exacting patriarch who, upon return from his frequent absences, called each of his five children into his office to peruse a handwritten list of their achievements and failures. She seems anguished in her response to one of Charles's notorious, bigoted speeches: "How could someone who spoke the words my father did in 1941," she asks, "how did such a person then raise children who by his instruction and his example, day after day and year after year, had learned from him ... that such words were repellent and unspeakable?" She offers too a blunt but tender portrait of Anne in old age--she has been physically and mentally impaired by a series of stroke--that proves she has a mature understanding of a deeply loving woman who nonetheless always held some part of herself in reserve for her writing. This impressive memoir brings readers close to the private people within two legendary public figures."We Lindberghs still know ourselves best as a tribe: close-knit, self-enclosed, and self-defining, always prepared to be besieged by invisible forces upwelling from the past...." <br> <br>The world knew Charles Lindbergh as a daring aviator, Pulitzer Prize-winning author, and controversial isolationist in World War II.&nbsp;&nbsp;His wife, Anne Morrow Lindbergh, was a bestselling author.&nbsp;&nbsp;To their five children they were Father, never Daddy, and Mother.&nbsp;&nbsp;Charles, a stern yet loving father, was surprisingly affectionate and playful; Anne provided a great, gentling love.&nbsp;&nbsp;With remarkable candor, their youngest daughter provides a rare, intimate look at her legendary family...the pervasive impact of her brother's kidnapping and death...the complexity of her parents' long, loving marriage...the night her life and her mother's converged, as Reeve's own infant son died suddenly.&nbsp;&nbsp;With grace and insight, Reeve Lindbergh appraises her remarkable parents, her unusual childhood, and the troubling questions that remain.&nbsp;&nbsp;At once an eloquent reminiscence and a slice of American history, <b>Under a Wing</b> is, at its core, a heartfelt tribute to an extraordinary family.</p><h2>Mister Jelly Roll: The Fortunes of Jelly Roll Morton, New Orleans Creole and &#34;Inventor of Jazz&#34;</h2><p>When it appeared in 1950, this biography of Ferdinand "Jelly Roll" Morton became an instant classic of jazz literature. Now back in print and updated with a new afterword by Lawrence Gushee, <i>Mister Jelly Roll</i> will enchant a new generation of readers with the fascinating story of one of the world's most influential composers of jazz. Jelly Roll's voice spins out his life in something close to song, each sentence rich with the sound and atmosphere of the period in which Morton, and jazz, exploded on the American and international scene. This edition includes scores of Jelly Roll's own arrangements, a discography and an updated bibliography, a chronology of his compositions, a new genealogical tree of Jelly Roll's forebears, and Alan Lomax's preface from the hard-to-find 1993 edition of this classic work. Lawrence Gushee's afterword provides new factual information and reasserts the importance of this work of African American biography to the study of jazz and American culture.</p><p><b>Alan Lomax,</b> with his father John A. Lomax, created the Archive of American Folk Song at the Library of Congress and published many anthologies, including <i>American Ballads and Folk Songs</i> and <i>The Folk Songs of North America.</i> Lomax produced the first albums of American folk song in 1939 and has edited more than a hundred recordings from all parts of the world. He received the National Medal of Arts in 1986. <b>Lawrence Gushee</b> is Professor Emeritus at the School of Music, University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign.&#34;You get a fresh idea of what was behind the development of the new music that said so many things to so many people. You see that jazz was actually a cultural transmission, as Mr. Lomax puts it, a &#39;wordless counterpoint of protest and pride.&#39; No one with even the slightest feeling for the subject can afford to miss this book.&#34;--&#34;San Francisco Chronicle</p><h2>The Promised One: Servant and Savior (Credo: Core Curriculum)</h2><p>The Promised One: Servant and Savior</p><p></p><h2>Siegfried Sassoon: Soldier, Poet, Lover, Friend</h2><p>Hailed as &#x201c;invaluable&#x201d; by the Times and &#x201c;thorough and perceptive&#x201d; by the Observer, Siegfried Sassoon encompasses the poet&#x2019;s complete life and works, from his patriotic youth that led him to the frontline, and flamboyant love affairs.

Four decades of research reveals that the effects of mentorship can be profound and enduring; strong mentoring relationships have the capacity to transform individuals and entire organizations. Organizations that retain and promote top talent-both female and male-are more likely to thrive.&nbsp; But the mentoring landscape is unequal. Evidence consistently shows that women face more barriers in securing mentorships than men, and when they do find a mentor, they may reap a narrower range of both career and psychological benefits. Athena Rising is a book for men about how to mentor women deliberately and effectively. It is a straightforward, no-nonsense manual for helping men of all institutions, organizations, and businesses to become excellent mentors to women.&nbsp; Co-authors W. Brad Johnson, PhD and David Smith, PhD draw from extensive research and years of experience as experts in mentoring relationships and gender workplace issues. When a man mentors a woman, they explain, the relationship is often complicated by conventional gender roles and at times hostile external perceptions. Traditional notions of mentoring are often modeled on male-to-male relationships-the sort that begin on the golf course, involve a nearly exclusive focus on career achievement, and include more than a few slaps on the back over drinks after work. But women often report a desire for mentoring that integrates career and interpersonal needs. Women want a mentor who not only "gets" this, but truly honors it.&nbsp; Men need to fully appreciate just how crucial their support of promising junior women can be in helping them to persist, promote, and thrive in their vocations and organizations. As women succeed, lean in, and assume leading roles in any organization or work context, that culture will become more egalitarian, effective, and prone to retaining top talent.</p><p><b>W.

His most recent publications include: On the Fast Track: Dual Military Couples Navigating Institutional Structures&#x201d; in <i>Contemporary Perspectives in Family Research</i> (2013), Dual Military Families: Confronting a Stubborn Military Institution&#x201d; in <i>Military Families and War in the 21st Century</i>, Comparative Perspectives (2015), Leadership and Peer Behaviors: Women in Combat&#x201d; in <i>Military Medicine</i> (2016) and Gender and the Military Profession: Early Career Influences, Attitudes and Intentions.&#x201d; in <i>Armed Forces &amp; Society.</i><i>Authors Brad Johnson and David Smith, both professors at the U.S. Naval Academy, hit a home run with this no-nonsense, timely guide that will benefit any man who wants to more effectively mentor or manage women in the workforce. Boldly stating that "traditionally masculine 'command and control' structures of hierarchical management are yesterday's news," and starting with a tutorial on self-awareness, the authors help the reader understand factors that harm women's careers and interfere with productive mentoring or management relationships. Seeking to illustrate "pervasive and pernicious attitudes" in the workplace, they tackle the stereotypes of women being too nice or not assertive enough, the "double jeopardy" of racial and gender bias, and the role of maternity. Then, drawing on academic research as well as real-life stories from senior-level women in organizations such as Coca-Cola, Sodexo, KPMG, NASA, and various branches of the military, the authors offer practical ways for mentors to lead, interact with, and champion women so they can succeed. Filled with useful advice and backed up by academic research, this handbook should be on every male business leader's reading list.&nbsp;(Publisher's Weekly, Sept. 2016)</i><br><br><i>Athena Rising reminds us that when men lean in for equality, we all benefit.

Leaders can no longer focus only on those who look like them; mentoring and developing all talent must become a core part of any organization's leadership style. Through engaging insights from global leaders and practical tips for men, Smith and Johnson echo Catalyst's long-standing point that when men are part of the solution--recognizing privilege and proactively championing gender equality within their organizations--that's when real change can occur. </i><br><b>Deborah Gillis, President &amp; Chief Executive Officer, Catalyst</b><i></i><br><i>&nbsp;</i><br><i>Brad Johnson and David Smith have served up an exceptional treatise and handbook for male executives to learn howto become mentors to rising women of promise in all our organizations.&nbsp; Athena Rising is written in a captivating style while providing a practical, step by step mentoring implementation plan to advance female stars in the workplace.

It was a must-read in 1978, putting object-relations theory on the map in the United States, and it remains a must-read today.

These tales--some adapted into such outstanding films as <i>Hombre</i>, <i>Valdez Is Coming</i>, and <i>3:10 to Yuma</i>--are unexcelled for their wiry tautness, sharp characterizations, and jolts of unexpected humor. For sheer stripped-down narrative tension Leonard never did anything better, and the fresh twists he finds in resolving the genre's classic confrontations reveal a master at work. Whether describing a Civil War veteran coming back to find his homestead stolen (<b>Last Stand at Saber River</b>), a man raised by Apaches treated with contempt by the white settlers who will ultimately depend on him for their survival (<b>Hombre</b>), a local constable, tricked into killing an innocent man, fighting back against the powerful man who duped him (<b>Valdez Is Coming</b>), or two convicts in a desert prison--one African American and the other half-Apache--plotting a near-impossible escape (<b>Forty Lashes Less One</b>), Leonard's westerns are tough, suspenseful, convincing, and beautifully spare in style.<br><br><b>LIBRARY OF AMERICA</b>&nbsp;is an independent nonprofit cultural organization founded in 1979 to preserve our nation&#x2019;s literary heritage by publishing, and keeping permanently in print, America&#x2019;s best and most significant writing.

Almost any common weed you are likely to encounter can be identified from its pages, in which you will also find much other data about it. Prepared by the United States Department of Agriculture, it is a painstaking, up-to-date survey of more than 220 important species.<br>At least two pages are devoted to each species. One contains a clear, accurate drawing of the plant in habit, flower, fruit, seeds, capsules, etc. Facing it is a full descriptive text that includes botanical notice, habitat, area, peculiarities, origin, etc., with a map in each case showing distribution throughout the United States. The species are arranged botanically, following the classificatory order. Both scientific and common names are given. A glossary explains all technical terms used, and a series of drawings shows the various types of leaves, roots, stems, fruits, flowers, and inflorescences for the nonbotanist.<br>The nature lover, collector, and hobbyist will discover here a specialty rich in interest and potential value, for much about the weeds still remains to be learned. For the botanist, this volume represents a useful ready reference. For the gardener, farmer, and livestock owner it can be an important aid. Even the general reader will find it inviting, explaining much about what he sees on virtually every patch of untended ground.</p><p></p><h2>Italian Cuisine: An Essential Reference with More than 300 Recipes</h2><p>Italy has produced one of the world&#x2019;s greatest and most beloved cuisines, filled with vibrant flavors and soul-satisfying dishes.

They appeared in various magazines and were published in book form when Gogol, who had spent his life in today's Ukraine up to the age of nineteen, was twenty-two. He put his early impressions and memories of childhood into these pictures of peasant life. This was Gogol's groundbreaking work, though not his first, and formed the core of his style, especially his sense of the macabre. It was this collection that proved he was a new power in Russian literature with unique innovation and a carefully arranged mingling of the horrifying and the humorous.</p><p><p>Nikolai Gogol was a Russian novelist and playwright born in what is now considered part of the modern Ukraine. By the time he was 15, Gogol worked as an amateur writer for both Russian and Ukrainian scripts, and then turned his attention and talent to prose. His short-story collections were immediately successful and his first novel, The Government Inspector, was well-received. Gogol went on to publish numerous acclaimed works, including Dead Souls, The Portrait, Marriage, and a revision of Taras Bulba. He died in 1852 while working on the second part of Dead Souls.</p></p><h2>White Nights and Other Stories (Dover Thrift Editions: Short Stories)</h2><p>From the author of <i>Crime and Punishment</i> comes this remarkable collection of short fiction.

Fyodor Dostoyevsky (1821&#x2013;1881) created powerful depictions of the human condition that led to significant developments in twentieth-century thought, including psychoanalysis and existentialism. His influence resonates in the works of latter-day authors such as Proust, Faulkner, Hemingway, and Kafka.

Bryer and Cathy W. Barks, with an introduction by Scott and Zelda's granddaughter, Eleanor Lanahan, this is a welcome addition to the Fitzgerald literary canon.</p><p>F. Scott Fitzgerald was born in St. Paul, Minnesota, in 1896. He attended Princeton University, joined the United States Army during World War I, and published his first novel, <i>This Side of Paradise</i>, in 1920. That same year he married Zelda Sayre and for the next decade the couple lived in New York, Paris, and on the Riviera. Fitzgerald&#x2019;s novels include <i>The Beautiful and the Damned</i>, <i>The Great Gatsby</i>, and <i>Tender Is the Night</i>. He died at the age of forty-four while working on <i>The Last Tycoon</i>. Fitzgerald&#x2019;s fiction has secured his reputation as one of the most important American writers of the 20th century.Dear Scott, Dearest Zelda <br>Scott and Zelda first met in Montgomery, Alabama, Zelda&#x2019;s hometown, in July 1918, probably at a country club dance. Zelda, who had just graduated from high school and was still the town&#x2019;s most popular girl, turned eighteen that month; Scott, who had attended Princeton and was now a lieutenant in the infantry, would be twenty-two that fall. In her autobiographical novel, Save Me the Waltz (1932), Zelda recalled that Scott, so handsome in his tailor-made Brooks Brothers uniform, had &#x201c;smelled like new goods&#x201d; as she nestled her &#x201c;face in the space between his ear and his stiff army collar&#x201d; while they danced (Collected Writings 39). Just two months later, Scott recorded in his Ledger the event that would shape the rest of his life and much of his work: &#x201c;Sept.: Fell in love on the 7th&#x201d;(Ledger 173). That same month, Scott summed up his twenty-first year: On his birthday, he wrote, &#x201c;A year of enormous importance. Work, and Zelda. Last year as a Catholic&#x201d; (Ledger 172). The major decisions that a young man coming of age makes&#x2014;matters of vocation, love, and faith&#x2014;had been decided.<br> <br>Scott, although still untried and immature in many ways, had adamantly committed himself to becoming &#x201c;one of the greatest writers who ever lived&#x201d; (as he told his college friend Edmund &#x201c;Bunny&#x201d; Wilson) and to having the &#x201c;top girl&#x201d; at his side to share the storybook life he envisioned. During his years at Princeton University, his academic life had taken a backseat to his social ambitions; realizing that he probably would never graduate, Scott had enlisted in the army in October 1917. His military training eventually brought him to Camp Sheridan, near Montgomery, and to Zelda&#x2014;the most beautiful, confident, and sought-after girl in town. Scott then devoted himself to becoming the &#x201c;top man&#x201d; among her many suitors, intending to vanquish the other young college boys and soldiers by marrying this most desirable girl.<br> <br>Zelda, being younger, was less clear about particulars, but she certainly shared Scott&#x2019;s romantic sense of a special destiny. Other than teaching, careers for women were still discouraged. Courtship and marriage were the areas in which young women such as Zelda, the daughter of a prominent judge, were expected to achieve distinction. Her three older sisters, Marjorie, Rosalind, and Clothilde, were already married; Zelda intended to make the absolute most of her own days as a southern belle, relishing her role in the spotlight. Montgomery may have been a small, provincial city, but it was surrounded by college towns, as well as being crowded with young soldiers from nearby training camps. The war imbued the local courtship rituals with an even greater sense of urgency and romanticism than usual. The crowds of young people necessitated numerous forms of entertainment&#x2014;parties, dances, sports, plays, and Friday-night vaudeville shows&#x2014;to keep them occupied. The Sayres&#x2019; front porch, replete with every sort of southern flower and a porch swing for Zelda and her beaux, was locally famous. Zelda had already filled a glove box with the small colorful badges of masculine honor the young soldiers took from their uniforms and gave to her as tokens of their affection. Scott soon added his own insignia to this collection. Young aviators from Taylor Field executed dangerous stunts as they flew their airplanes over Zelda&#x2019;s house to impress her. Scott competed with such exploits by bragging about the famous writer he was going to become. Although Scott did not &#x201c;get over&#x201d; to fight the war, that summer and fall, as he vied for Zelda&#x2019;s heart, the two no doubt believed that he would be sent overseas and perhaps face death. He continued to write, hoping that in the event of his death, he would become the American counterpart of Rupert Brooke, the handsome young English poet, who in death had become the romantic hero&#x2014; forever young, beautiful, and full of promise.<br> <br>The war, however, ended just as Scott was preparing to embark for France. When he was discharged in February 1919, he went to New York City to find a job and to become a famous living writer, instead of a dead one. He hoped to find work with a newspaper but had to settle for a low-paying job with an advertising firm. He missed Zelda terribly, told his family about her, and asked his mother to write to Zelda, which she did. Then, on March 24, Scott sent Zelda the engagement ring that had been his mother&#x2019;s. Zelda couldn&#x2019;t have been more thrilled. But although her letters are full of enthusiastic assurances of her love, her life in Montgomery continued pretty much the same as before&#x2014;a whirlwind of social engagements, which included continuing to go out with other boys&#x2014;and she wrote Scott all about it. Zelda especially loved the rounds of college parties, dances, and commencement activities beginning in May and the exciting football weekends in the fall. Scott&#x2019;s daily life, on the other hand, was at total odds with his idealized conception of himself. He hated his job, hated having so little money, and especially hated how his clothes were becoming threadbare. And, worse yet, his stories weren&#x2019;t selling. Later, in &#x201c;My Lost City&#x201d; (1936), he would look back and write, &#x201c;. . . I was haunted always by my other life . . . my fixation upon the day&#x2019;s letter from Alabama&#x2014;would it come and what would it say?&#x2014;my shabby suits, my poverty, and love. . . . I was a failure&#x2014; mediocre at advertising work and unable to get started as a writer&#x201d; (Crack-Up 25&#x2013;26).<br> <br>Despite his sense of failure, Scott was actually quite productive. Although he sold only one story in the spring of 1919&#x2014;&#x201c;Babes in the Woods,&#x201d; for which The Smart Set paid him thirty dollars&#x2014;he continued his apprenticeship and produced over nineteen stories that winter and spring. All were rejected by the magazines to which he submitted them; many, however, were later revised and published. Although Scott was being unrealistic in his expectations of immediate fame&#x2014;who, after all, is a blazing success at the age of twenty-two?&#x2014;his sense of failure, anxiety, and loss was keen and would remain with him the rest of his life. When Scott visited Zelda in Montgomery in mid-April, he was depressed and losing confidence in himself. Zelda tried to reassure him in her letters, but she also continued to report on all the fun she was having.<br> <br>By June 1919, Scott and Zelda&#x2019;s engagement was in serious jeopardy. When Scott received a note that Zelda had written to another suitor and then accidentally put into the wrong envelope, one addressed to Scott, he was enraged and ordered her never to write to him again. But as soon as he received Zelda&#x2019;s brief explanation, he went to Montgomery and begged her to marry him right away. Zelda cried in his arms, but she turned him down and broke the engagement. Scott returned to New York feeling utterly defeated as a writer and a lover. He wrote to a friend: &#x201c;I&#x2019;ve done my best and I&#x2019;ve failed&#x2014;it&#x2019;s a great tragedy to me and I feel I have very little left to live for. . . . Unless someday she will marry me I will never marry&#x201d; (Letters 455&#x2013;456). He quit his job, went on a three-week bender, returned to his parents&#x2019; home in St. Paul, and went to work revising &#x201c;The Romantic Egotist,&#x201d; the novel that had been rejected by Charles Scribner&#x2019;s Sons in 1918. During this period of a little over two months, Scott and Zelda exchanged no letters. But when Scribners accepted his novel, now entitled This Side of Paradise, on September 16, 1919, Scott immediately wrote to Zelda again and planned a visit to Montgomery; the couple soon resumed their engagement. More letters and visits to Montgomery followed, and Zelda and Scott were married the following April, only one year after Scott had first sent Zelda the engagement ring.<br> <br>In his imagination, Scott attached the acquisition of Zelda to the acquisition of material success, thereby identifying what were already the twin themes of his writing&#x2014;love and money&#x2014;as the twin themes of his life, as well. Later, he looked back on the summer of his broken engagement in &#x201c;Pasting It Together&#x201d; (1936) and wrote, &#x201c;It was one of those tragic loves doomed for lack of money&#x201d; and that although when he became &#x201c;the man with the jingle of money in his pocket,&#x201d; he &#x201c;married the girl&#x201d; after all, he would never trust either money or love&#x2014;the same elements of life to which he was most drawn (Crack-Up 77). Zelda&#x2019;s imagination, however, was committed solely to the enchantment of love. Her letters from this period offer evidence that dispels two enduring but misleading myths about her marriage to Scott: first, that Zelda would not marry him until he had money; second, that one of the reasons Scott interested her was because she was eager to leave her small town for the larger social stage of New York City. It is true that Zelda&#x2019;s parents certainly had reservations about their daughter marrying a young man with no secure prospects for the future, but Zelda repeatedly reassures Scott in these letters that love, not money, is what she wants most out of life. Although they resumed their engagement after Scribners accepted Scott&#x2019;s novel, it hadn&#x2019;t been published yet and there was no assurance that it would be a moneymaker. Once the engagement was settled, Zelda eagerly anticipated joining Scott in New York, but her enthusiasm again was for being with Scott and not the larger possibilities the so-called glittering city offered. Zelda loved Montgomery, especially its beautiful flowers, and she knew she would miss the way of life she had always known.<br> <br>While these letters challenge the myths, they also offer a vivid portrait of Zelda at eighteen&#x2014;a flirtatious, audacious young woman, whose life was full of friends, practical jokes, and parties. Her letters indicate that although she believed that provoking jealousy was an important ritual in courtship, she did not feel that she was being unfaithful to Scott by dating other men; they also reveal that she felt no hesitation in reporting it all to him. In addition to telling Scott about an endless stream of social engagements, she also articulated her ideas about life and love&#x2014;that women were intended be &#x201c;a disturbing element among&#x201d; men and that even though she loved to appear all &#x201c;pink and helpless,&#x201d; the men who thought her &#x201c;purely decorative&#x201d; were &#x201c;fools for not knowing better&#x201d; (letters 16 and 28). Scott, who had a wonderful ear for words, freely borrowed passages from these letters for his fiction.<br> <br>Certain themes emerge from the events and letters of this period that foreshadow characteristics and conflicts that will persist throughout the Fitzgeralds&#x2019; lives together. Jealousy was certainly a factor. According to Fitzgerald biographer Arthur Mizener, when Scott and Zelda first started seeing each other, she pulled another date into a lighted phone booth and initiated a spirited kissing session, which ended when she said, &#x201c;Scott was coming and I wanted to make him jealous&#x201d; (83). As Scott Donaldson and others have suggested, one of the reasons Scott was attracted to Zelda (as well as to earlier girlfriends, such as the Chicago socialite Ginevra King) was because of their many suitors. In order to be the &#x201c;top girl&#x201d; he wanted, she had to be popular with other men. Yet when Scott tried to play the same game and wrote to her from New York that he found a young woman very attractive, Zelda called his bluff, giving him the go-head to kiss the girl, a response guaranteed to turn the tables and make Scott worry even more about what Zelda herself might be doing in Montgomery. When Scott looked back on this period in &#x201c;Early Success&#x201d; (1937), he recalled that some of his friends had &#x201c;arrangements with &#x2018;sensible&#x2019; girls,&#x201d; but he noted, &#x201c;Not I&#x2014;I was in love with a whirlwind and I must spin a net big enough to catch it . . .&#x201d; (Crack-Up 86). The great paradox of their love affair is that the same traits that attracted them to each other would also create chaos and conflict in their lives. Just as the jealousies so playful during courtship would take on a more destructive role in their marriage, alcohol, considered a harmless rite of passage for the young, would become an increasingly destructive factor, one that would continue to haunt them.<br> <br>In addition to jealousy and alcohol as troubling factors in their relationship, each had a distinct personality sharply divided and pulled in opposing directions. The split in Scott&#x2019;s personality has been thoroughly analyzed and much written about. His contemporary Malcolm Cowley perceptively argued that Scott possessed a &#x201c;double vision,&#x201d; by which he meant that he had the ability to throw himself wholeheartedly into dissipation, despite his deeply embedded puritanism. Scott gave Nick Carraway, the narrator of The Great Gatsby, this trait, as well: &#x201c;I was within and without,&#x201d; states Nick, &#x201c;simultaneously enchanted and repelled by the inexhaustible variety of life&#x201d; (40). Such double vision would help make Scott a great writer, but it would also allow him to become an emblem of the material excesses and moral corruption of the 1920s, at the same time that his writing provided a prophetic judgment against the period. The divided aspect of Zelda&#x2019;s personality, however, has not been adequately recognized or analyzed.<br> <br>Zelda most aptly described her own divided personality in Save Me the Waltz, saying that it was &#x201c;very difficult to be two simple people at once, one who wants to have a law to itself and the other who wants to . . . be loved and safe and protected&#x201d; (Collected Writings 56). Although Zelda, age thirty at the time she wrote the novel, was looking backward at the young girl she had once been, this conflicting pull between dependency and independence also emerges vividly in the letters she wrote at eighteen, in passionate declarations of love expressed by a willful, spirited young woman, but one who, in the ardor of youth, desired to merge with the beloved as closely and completely as possible. These expressions, along with her equally passionate expressions of independence, also represent a more deeply embedded aspect of Zelda&#x2019;s personality, one that will reemerge in her letters in the 1930s, in which she vacillated between valiant struggles to establish herself as a writer (and therefore create economic independence) and her deeply felt gratitude for and need of Scott&#x2019;s continued provisions for her care.<br> <br>Sadly, Scott&#x2019;s letters to Zelda from this period do not survive. We have only urgent telegrams he sent to Zelda (which she pasted in her scrapbook), announcing the numerous visits he hurriedly planned to make to Montgomery, afraid that if he was not around, another suitor would win her. Scott did express his view of her in a letter to a friend; writing in February 1920, just before his marriage, he admitted, &#x201c;My friends are unanimous in frankly advising me not to marry a wild, pleasure loving girl like Zelda so I&#x2019;m quite used to it.&#x201d; Notwithstanding such warnings, Scott, in this same letter, clearly expressed his understanding of Zelda&#x2019;s temperament and his commitment to her:<br> <br>No personality as strong as Zelda&#x2019;s could go without getting critisisms and as you say she is not above approach. I&#x2019;ve always known that. . . . But . . . I fell in love with her courage, her sincerity and her flaming self respect and its these things I&#x2019;d believe in even if the whole world indulged in wild suspicions that she wasn&#x2019;t all that she should be.<br> <br>But of course the real reason . . . is that I love her and that&#x2019;s the beginning and end of everything. (Correspondence 53)<br> <br>While the loss of Scott&#x2019;s courtship letters to Zelda is a great one, perhaps there are some advantages to be gained from Zelda&#x2019;s le...</p><h2>Motel Fetish</h2><p><p><b>ustful places, luscious women</b><br> �&nbsp;</p>"Taschen is this art vampire.

Reprint. Movie tie-in.</p><p>As Clarissa Dalloway walks through London on a fine June morning, a sky-writing plane captures her attention. Crowds stare upwards to decipher the message while the plane turns and loops, leaving off one letter, picking up another. Like the airplane's swooping path, Virginia Woolf's <i>Mrs. Dalloway</i> follows Clarissa and those whose lives brush hers--from Peter Walsh, whom she spurned years ago, to her daughter Elizabeth, the girl's angry teacher, Doris Kilman, and war-shocked Septimus Warren Smith, who is sinking into madness.<p> As Mrs. Dalloway prepares for the party she is giving that evening, a series of events intrudes on her composure. Her husband is invited, without her, to lunch with Lady Bruton (who, Clarissa notes anxiously, gives the most amusing luncheons). Meanwhile, Peter Walsh appears, recently from India, to criticize and confide in her. His sudden arrival evokes memories of a distant past, the choices she made then, and her wistful friendship with Sally Seton.</p><p> Woolf then explores the relationships between women and men, and between women, as Clarissa muses, "It was something central which permeated; something warm which broke up surfaces and rippled the cold contact of man and woman, or of women together.... Her relation in the old days with Sally Seton. Had not that, after all, been love?" While Clarissa is transported to past afternoons with Sally, and as she sits mending her green dress, Warren Smith catapults desperately into his delusions. Although his troubles form a tangent to Clarissa's web, they undeniably touch it, and the strands connecting all these characters draw tighter as evening deepens. As she immerses us in each inner life, Virginia Woolf offers exquisite, painful images of the past bleeding into the present, of desire overwhelmed by society's demands. <i>--Joannie Kervran Stangeland</i></p>This edition of Mrs. Dalloway includes substantial explanatory notes compiling past scholarship while identifying new allusions, and a list of textual variants among all editions in Woolf&#39;s lifetime. It also features a composition history, documenting how Woolf&#39;s reading, friendships, and culture contributed to the book, and Woolf&#39;s seldom-reprinted 1928 introduction.</p><h2>Introduction to Statistical Investigations</h2><p>A textbook for Statistical Investigations</p><p></p><h2>Historical and Philosophical Issues in the Conservation of Cultural Heritage (Readings in Conservation)</h2><p>This is the first comprehensive collection of texts on the conservation of art and architecture to be published in the English language.

It focuses on the themes, issues, and controversies that occurred throughout the century&#x2014;using selections that are contemporary with the art&#x2014;by artists, critics, exhibition organizers, poets, politicians, and other writers on culture. <b> </b> Some recurring themes and issues include issues of identity; the changing nature of modernism and modernity; nationalism; art as individual or community expression; the nature of public art; and the role of criticism, censorship, and government intervention. Texts by well-known writers include Meyer Schapiro, Clement Greenberg, Michael Fried, Donald Kuspit, and Kate Linker. <b> </b> A guide for those interested in both the standard interpretations of American art and in alternative readings. </p></p><p>Preface <p> This book focuses on the issues and controversies that have energized American art from 1900 to the present. The entries are contemporary with the art (except for a few excerpts from later memoirs) and include the views of artists, critics, exhibition organizers, poets, politicians, art activists, and writers on culture. The book is intended to serve as a handbook for courses on American and contemporary art and also as a guide to those interested in both the standard interpretations of American art and in alternative readings. </p><p> A greet number and variety of voices have been included. This broad spectrum better achieves a replication of the artworld itself&#x2014;a world made up of diverse practitioners who pursue many agendas and various points of view, and who influence and help direct both the production of the art of our time and its critical and popular reception. </p><p> These artworkers continually refer to and build on one another's ideas when engaged in, describing, or interpreting art and art activities. As Max Kozloff has observed, "What we feel about visual works of art is . . . conditioned by what has already been said about them." It is the dialogue about art that enables a wide network of people to participate in art movements. These people include studio and art history teachers, dealers, museum directors, government funding officers, publishers, magazine editors, and individual enthusiasts who may also be collectors. They make possible the training and traveling opportunities for artists and critics; they host and finance exhibitions; they enable the distribution of new images and ideas. Both practioners and facilitators, with their complex network of social and professional relationships, are fully implicated in the consolidation and direction of art movements. Hence, the comments of all artworld people&#x2014;writing contemporaneously with the new art-are considered as primary documents. </p><p> A new movement of artistic trends is not a one-dimensional linear progression, as art history books often present it, but rather an expanding and contracting process. There is a growth period, followed by a consolidation. Then a shifting&#x2014;of people, ideas, styles&#x2014;from the margins to the center, and often back to the margins as new people, ideas, styles emerge to challenge or to be absorbed into the previously dominant movements. The older movements, although still attracting loyal curators, dealers, and patrons, often move into the background&#x2014;removed from all the buzz about the newer art. Galleries may go out of business as the novelty of their artists wanes, or they may establish niche markets for themselves. At the same time, artists may stay with their own cohort in defiance of new trends, or they may change styles&#x2014;as did many during the 1950s when abstract expressionism swept the artworld. Writers and curators, too, are capable of shifting gears&#x2014;of adopting new sensibilities and even ideologies as they position themselves to understand, interpret, and promote new movements in art. </p><p> During the twentieth century, theories about art, culture, and social life have increasingly and much more self-consciously influenced artworld participants, and, therefore, many theoretical essays are included here. Theories about art, however, need to be tested by the practices adopted by both artists and critics as they confront and question the relevance and applicability of those theories. What we find as the mediation between theory and practice is experience. Hence, many entries in this book focus on the immediately recalled experiences of artists and writers as they approach&#x2014;both personally and collectively&#x2014;the art of their time, or as they encounter the social, political, and economic conditions that encourage or suppress specific art ideas and subjects. These experiences, as well as the contested theories and beliefs, will give readers of this book a better understanding of the changing artworld. </p><p> Some art world people seem to be in the right place at the right time with the right blend of predispositions. Or, as George Kubler has observed, some artists seem to have a better "entrance" than others. In other words, these artists spoke (and speak) to their contemporaries in ways that resonate with shared experiences. It is risky, however, to predict what will have staying power, since under some historical circumstances people become quick to deny those shared experiences. Documents included in this reader suggest the complex relationships that art has to its history. </p><p> Modern Art in the USA presents themes and issues that have reappeared over the century, frequently erupting into highly publicized controversies. </p><p> The reigning phenomenon of the twentieth century has been modernism, which has generated a variety of changing definitions from the early decades to the present. Early in the century, modernism meant "to be of one's time" (much like the definition of realism in the nineteenth century). The definition was inclusive and hospitable to experimental techniques, materials, and concepts. It opposed academic rules and set ways of thinking. At mid-century, during the Cold War years and with the dominance of Clement Greenberg's critical authority, modernism came to have a more narrow, formalist definition with a set of seemingly inflexible rules. Greenberg then defined modernism as embodying "purity" of form and characterized by "self-referentiality." By the end of the twentieth century, however, many critics have reasserted the more inclusive definition of modernism that had characterized the earlier decades. Indeed, the term "postmodernism" has often been substituted to describe a modern art that also includes the traditions of realism and the vernacular. </p><p> Looking back on the twentieth century, we see that modernism (whatever its definitions) was not the only component to modern art in the USA. Throughout the history of the country, realism&#x2014;in its many different visual styles&#x2014;has persisted as a vital outlook. Even when the modernism of abstract expressionism seemed to be in ascendency, realists held their own. In 1955, when the Whitney Museum of American Art mounted the exhibition The New Decade: 35American Painters and Sculptors and the Museum of Modern Art mounted The New Decade: 22 European Painters and Sculptors, it was the Whitney's show that made it a point to showcase contemporary realists along with the rising abstract expressionists. Whitney curator John I. H. Baur explained: "Our aim has been to record something of the diversity and vitality of American art . . . ." </p><p> Another component of modern art in the USA has been the continuing fascination artists have had for the commonplace: the vernacular, the practical, the mechanical, and the popular. This attraction to the commonplace results from the fact that many Americans&#x2014;including a great number of artists&#x2014;have held on to the ideal that the country is a democracy and that Americans are somehow equal. The French writer and traveler Alexis de Tocqueville noted this dogged belief back in 1832, when he published his Democracy in America; Americans, he observed, had contempt for aristocracy even when they secretly aspired to aristocracy's status. The ideal of democracy and egalitarianism has persisted through the end of the twentieth century, even in the face of the reality of huge income and net-worth differences between the wealthy and the working classes. </p><p> A major recurring theme in art throughout the century has focused on the social dimensions of art and art making&#x2014;of bringing social concerns into the content of art and of debating the relevance of politics to art. Do artists have an obligation to communicate uplifting and positive social and collective values? Or should socially concerned artists confine themselves to criticizing the negative and oppressively materialist aspects of life in the United States and around the globe in order to encourage social change? Such issues were especially debated in artistic and intellectual circles in the 1930s and again from the late 1960s to the present. </p><p> This issue of the social responsibility of art and artists ties in with the concept of the audience for art. Should that audience be the moneyed elites who can afford luxury items, that is, expensively priced paintings and sculpture to adorn their personal living spaces? Or should art be directed toward the general populace? And if the latter, what are the best means to reach and engage ordinary people? </p><p> Issues of "identity" weave through the art and the art commentary of the entire twentieth century. In the first three decades, questions of identity focused on nationalism. What does it mean to be "American" as opposed to European? With African Americans, identity issues revolved around race and W.E.B. Du Bois's concept of "double consciousness" (see Reading 8). From the 1930s to the mid-1950s social class loomed as a major factor of one's identity. Beginning in the mid-1950s, growing consumerism among the middle classes masked the poverty that still existed in the United States. However, prosperity and the prospect of prosperity encouraged hope. In the modern art of African Americans the theme of racial pride asserted itself. </p><p> By the late 1960s and early 1970s gender issues also began to preoccupy many women artists and critics. The continuing exploration of gender and racial identities, joined by critiques of neocolonialist power relations and criticism against norms for sexual behavior, infused much art of the 1980s and 1990s. Inevitably, this exploration of subject matter invited attacks and attempts at censorship from religious organizations and politicians. By the late 1990s, however, the rise of globalism encouraged a shift toward the recognition that people carry multiple identities. And, with the wars in the Balkans and in Africa, it became increasingly acknowledged that fixations on ethnicity and ethnic identity dangerously paved the way for "ethnic cleansing" and genocide. </p><p> As we review the century, we see modernism's inclusiveness has triumphed. Photography has rightly won its place as a category for serious art. Conceptual art, with its roots in the ideas of Marcel Duchamp and the Dadaists, has also found a permanent place in the artworld, as have installations, video, multimedia art, and performance art&#x2014;in spite of admonishments in the 1960s to artists that such innovations were "theater" and should be avoided in the plastic arts. The digitized and computer generated arts will no doubt come into their own in the twenty-first century, for they are already firmly established in experimental labs in industry and have become part of the curriculum in many studio art programs. This expansion of the category of "art" to include all kinds of activities, processes, and objects will change the way we teach and think about visual culture in the future. </p><p> In conclusion, twentieth-century American art was forged in a cauldron of contentions, arguments, and ideological struggle. It is not a smooth, seamless history, but a history punctuated by controversy and debate. What arises as a fierce controversy in one generation becomes resolved, ignored, or absorbed into the next generation's art and art commentary. The art of the present is the richer for these controversies and struggles.</p><p>Includes writings and documents by artists, critics, exhibition organizers, poets, and politicians on the issues and controversies of twentieth-century art movements:</p> <p> </p><ul> <li>Realism as a radical project</li> <li>Modernism and American consciousness</li> <li>Machine Age modernity</li> <li>The "New Negro" and the jazz age</li> <li>Photography as art</li> <li>Photography as force for social change</li> <li>Art for the people</li> <li>Abstract expressionism</li> <li>The Cold War and the arts</li> <li>Pop Art in New York, Chicago, and California</li> <li>Conceptual Art and Earthworks</li> <li>Political and Anti-war art</li> <li>Black Arts movement</li> <li>Feminist movement</li> <li>Postmodernism</li> <li>Identity politics and body art</li> <li>Art in public spaces</li> <li>Censorship and the culture wars</li> </ul></p><h2>How to Build a Universe: From the Big Bang to the End of the Universe</h2><p>The universe&#x2014;demystified!

Will states with the largest, best equipped, information-technology-rich militaries invariably win? The prevailing answer today among both scholars and policymakers is yes. But this is to overlook force employment, or the doctrine and tactics by which materiel is actually used. In a landmark reconception of battle and war, this book provides a systematic account of how force employment interacts with materiel to produce real combat outcomes. Stephen Biddle argues that force employment is central to modern war, becoming increasingly important since 1900 as the key to surviving ever more lethal weaponry. Technological change produces opposite effects depending on how forces are employed; to focus only on materiel is thus to risk major error--with serious consequences for both policy and scholarship.</p><br><p> In clear, fluent prose, Biddle provides a systematic account of force employment's role and shows how this account holds up under rigorous, multimethod testing. The results challenge a wide variety of standard views, from current expectations for a revolution in military affairs to mainstream scholarship in international relations and orthodox interpretations of modern military history.</p><br><br><p> <i>Military Power</i> will have a resounding impact on both scholarship in the field and on policy debates over the future of warfare, the size of the military, and the makeup of the defense budget.</p></p><p><p>"Stephen Biddle's <i>Military Power</i> is one of the most important contributions to strategic studies in recent decades. Presenting a very powerful case for a very surprising argument on a very important question, it will be controversial in some quarters, but critics will be hard-pressed to refute the case."<b>--Richard K. Betts, Columbia University, author of<i>Military Readiness</i></b></p><p>"Fascinating, precisely written, indeed, brilliant, <i>Military Power</i> is among the most important books ever published on modern warfare. Stephen Biddle fundamentally rethinks the causes of victory and defeat in modern war and challenges almost the entire corpus of scholarship on assessing force capability and the role of offense and defense in determining war outcomes. Presenting his argument with power, balance, and subtlety, he synthesizes many partial historical explanations and provides a basis for understanding why so many 'rules of thumb' and other explanations are misleading. A landmark work."<b>--Lynn Eden, Stanford University, author of<i>Whole World on Fire</i></b></p><p>"Steve Biddle may be the best American defense analyst of his generation, and this book is quite possibly his career masterpiece to date. Few are as well qualified as Biddle to weave together vivid descriptions of the modern battlefield, clear explanations of historical lessons, a detailed understanding of defense technology, and a sophisticated use of military models and war games. Biddle does all these things, helping the reader understand modern warfare more than does any other book on the market. His argument about trends in warfare transcends the popular theory that a revolution in military affairs is now underway. He replaces this theory with a more convincing, more historical, and less technology-obsessed view of the modern battlefield."<b>--Michael O'Hanlon, Senior Fellow, Brookings Institution</b></p><b>Stephen Biddle</b> is Senior Fellow in Defense Policy at the Council on Foreign Relations.

In the consistent model, a code of 870 signs mirrors a complex knowledge of modern sciences, while explaining the potential of our DNA for genetic immortality. Put simply, human DNA can survive at death if the individual has knowledge of the transformation process. To evolve, one needs scientific knowledge describing the process, and this knowledge has been systematically secreted by the power elite. Surprisingly, Egyptian deities mirror the activities of our microbial ancestors, and since Christianity&#39;s deities mirror the activities of Egyptian deities, religion has also preserved an evolutionary science for survival of human DNA in a quantum environment. Supported by 318 scientific citations, The Isis Thesis examines ancient Egyptian texts, art and architecture through the dual lens of contemporary science and human behavior, showing that human beings have the potential to evolve at death into a unique hybrid species. On October 25, 2006, Judy Kay King presented the Isis Thesis at the Second International Congress for Young Egyptologists in Lisbon, Portugal. Since that presentation, King has written 12 peer-reviewed articles published in international journals, showing that the Egyptian evolutionary knowledge is also present in cultures such as early China, the Aztecs, the Navajo, as well as many historical individuals and creative artists (see Isis Thesis website). This knowledge about genetic immortality is also summarized in King s new book entitled Balls of Fire: a Science of Life and Death (2015), another nonfiction study that uses a baseball game format to present the case for and against the Isis Thesis. Like religion, baseball originated in ancient Egypt to describe the pharaoh s chemistry for a sustainable new entity with unique interaction qualities at a human death. On April 11, 2016, Balls of Fire won First Place under Body, Mind, Spirit for Reader Views Literary Awards (2015-2016). Also, Balls of Fire has been recognized as a Finalist in the 18th annual Foreword Reviews INDIEFAB Book of the Year Awards under the Nonficton Adult category of Body, Mind, Spirit.</p><p>Judy K. King, M.A., is a former college English instructor, whose graduate education was rooted in the literary theories of Derrida, Foucault, Levi-Strauss, Heidegger and many others interested in the study of signs and the origin of the work of art. She presented a paper on The Isis Thesis at the Third International Conference on New Directions in the Humanities at the University of Cambridge, UK on August 3, 2005. On October 25, 2006, she presented another scientific paper on The Isis Thesis to the Second International Congress for Young Egyptologists in Lisbon, Portugal.Life Technology News Thursday, October 05, 2006 Written By Judy Kay King, The Isis Thesis is a book that promises to turn the worlds of Science and Egyptology on their respective heads, uniting the two in a way that a few years ago, nobody could have predicted. Ms King has spent several years using a technique called biosemiotics - the biological science of signs and messages in living systems, to study every facet of Egyptology. After years of intensive research, she has arrived at an astonishing conclusion, that there is an undeniable interrelationship between the mythology of ancient Egypt and molecular biology. The Ancient Egyptians were aware of not only bacterial genetics but also molecular biology, cosmology related to string theory, back hole theory and even dark energy. To put it simply, Egyptian cosmology is mirrored by microbiology to such an extent that it cannot be considered coincidence. The Ancient Egyptians had a deep understanding of science and encoded their scientific knowledge in the Egyptian language; five thousand years later, we have clear evidence that this is the case. Judy King's research has decoded a complex scientific sign system which maps the pathway of a chemical reaction, and provides the key to symbols found in the ancient myths of Sumer, Babylonia, India, and Greece. For a long time, conventional understanding of Ancient Egyptian Hieroglyphs has considered them as being strictly funerary in nature. However, The Isis Thesis suggests that while accepting their funerary guise, encoded in the hieroglyphic symbols themselves is a fully developed science that rivals and in some cases surpasses modern science. Judy Kay King puts forward the remarkable assertion that the Ancient Egyptians had quite a detailed working knowledge of molecular biology, astrophysics, molecular chemistry, and quantum physics. The Isis Thesis shows how such disciplines were hidden for thousands of years, waiting for their secrets to be unlocked. The book takes areas such as microbiology and genetics and uses semiotics (the theoretical framework for the study of the meaning of language, signs and symbols) to explore these areas from a modern standpoint and then through the perspective of the Ancient Egyptians, explaining how these areas were incorporated into the ancient texts. Ms King covers a wide range of scientific understanding in her research. The methodology employed in The Isis Thesis, is itself unique. The author establishes a demonstrative template of thirty different themes to outline her hypothesis. The point Judy Kay King makes is both startling and fascinating. The contention she puts forward is that the ritual and mythology of the Egyptian understanding of the journey to the afterlife incorporated all natural sciences. Passages from nine well-known ancient texts including: The Pyramid Texts, the Coffin Texts and The Book of Gates have been carefully studied during the course of the research. The book identifies the sections, words and themes that illustrate how this scientific knowledge was woven into the fabric of the texts themselves. By any standard, this was a formidable undertaking. The author presents as evidence 870 decoded signs that define not only the protein path of Phage Lambda and its carrier host E. coli, but demonstrates how the deceased symbolically followed that path on their journey to the afterlife. If the ideas put forward in The Isis Thesis are borne out, it offers clear evidence that religious and scientific understanding of the Ancient Egyptians was based on the structure of a simple protein, Phage Lambda and its relationship with a simple bacteria, E Coli. Not only is that structure imprinted on our Universe as a whole, it suggests that the Egyptian concept of the microcosm and macrocosm was underpinned not by mythology, but by science --Life Technology News 2006<br><br>For review, see youtube video entitled The Isis Thesis by Natural Gift --Youtube Book Review by Natural Gift</p><h2>Prentice-Hall Nursing Reviews &amp; Rationales: Medical-Surgical Nursing, 2nd Edition</h2><p>Essential for NCLEX, course and competencey review, this resource is a complete, concentrated outline of medical-surgical nursing.

Ever since, there has been enormous disagreement over who the Molly Maguires were, what they did, and why they did it, as virtually everything we now know about the Molly Maguires is based on the hostile descriptions of their contemporaries.<br><br>Arguing that such sources are inadequate to serve as the basis for a factual narrative, author Kevin Kenny examines the ideology behind contemporary evidence to explain how and why a particular meaning came to be associated with the Molly Maguires in Ireland and Pennsylvania. At the same time, this work examines new archival evidence from Ireland that establishes that the American Molly Maguires were a rare transatlantic strand of the violent protest endemic in the Irish countryside.<br><br>Combining social and cultural history, <em>Making Sense of the Molly Maguires</em> offers a new explanation of who the Molly Maguires were, as well as why people wrote and believed such curious things about them. In the process, it vividly retells one of the classic stories of American labor and immigration.<br></p><p><br><strong>Kevin Kenny</strong> is Assistant Professor of History at the University of Texas at Austin.<br><br>"This terrific book adds much to our understanding of the Molly Maguires and provides details about the social and ethnic landscapes of eastern Pennsylvania. It also sheds new light on how many Irish Americans understood Catholicism."--<em>American Historical Review</em><p></p><br>"This is a rich and subtly crafted interpretation of the Molly Maguires and their world, and the reader benefits from the prodigious research Kenny carried out...Kenny's definitive study presents a nuanced vision of the Molly Maguires' lives and the world they lived in; and his book sheds a remarkable light more generally on labour struggles in the mid-19th century."--<em>Labor History</em><p></p><br>"Kevin Kenny's <em>Making Sense of the Molly Maguires</em> is easily the best book ever written about the subject. It is meticulously researched, carefully argued, and well written, and it brings all of the events to life...His book is a story of the hardships of the mines, of the power of the owners and their paid police forces, and most especially of the power of the media to portray the events in such a way as to inflame persons around the nation. And this book is about the way we write history...The controversy over the Molly Maguires will not end with Kenny's book. Some will see them as brutal terrorists and others as martyred heroes of the labor movement. But no one will ever again be able to think or write seriously about the 1870s violence in the anthracite coal region [of eastern Pennsylvania] without reading this stunning volume."--Kenneth T. Jackson, Columbia University, in a review for the History Book Club, January 1998<p></p><br>"Until now the Molly Maguires have dwelled in the half-light of myth and propaganda. No longer. In <em>Making Sense of the Molly Maguires</em>, Kevin Kenny dispels the shadows. Kenny gives us the flesh-and-blood men, their passions and grievances, the crimes they committed and the crimes committed against them. This is a first-class work of scholarship that unfolds with the power of a detective novel. Along with making sense of the Molly Maguires, Kenny has produced an outstanding piece of historical enlightenment. He made me think, and he made me weep. I am in awe of his achievement."--Peter Quinn, author of <em>Banished Children of Eve</em><p></p><br>"After thorough research in both Irish and American sources, Kevin Kenny has produced by far the best and the most sensitive treatment of the Molly Maguires, the Irish-born anthracite miners who battled corporate capitalism and its legal and clerical allies in Gilded-Age Pennsylvania. Kenny's book does far more than <em>make sense</em> of this important and tragic episode, for his is a very major contribution to our general understanding of working-class, immigration, and Irish-American history."--Kerby Miller, University of Missouri-Columbia<p></p><br>"<em>Making Sense of the Molly Maguires</em> is destined to become a definitive work on the subject and one that this reviewer recommends highly."--Thomas Larkin, <em>An Scathan</em><p></p><br>"Kenny's treatment of the Mollies is thoroughly researched and neatly balanced...Kenny has assimilated and built on a century of scholarship. His excavation beneath the mythical qualities of the Molly Maguires is likely to be the standard work for some time."--<em>Labor Studies Journal</em><p></p><br>"Kevin Kenny's book plunges right into this complex amalgam of events and perceptions to understand both sides of the Mollys...Kenny's monograph is well reasoned and effectively constructed...[T]his study gives the Molly Maguires their proper place in late-nineteenth-century America, not as devils or angels, but as real men engaged in real and often violent struggles for a living and a life."--<em>The North Carolina Historical Review</em><p></p><br>"Intended as a book about the Molly Maguires both as an organization and as a symbol of unionism, Kenny tries first to understand how community was constituted among Irish-American miners. He then seeks to understand how the violent murders committed by a secret organization came to stand as a middle-class symbol of the dangers of unions and Irish workers...Kenny has demonstrated how the exploration of memory can help broaden the scope of labor history."--<em>Reviews in American History</em><p></p><br>"[A] remarkably fine work of historical research and analysis."--Thomas Flanagan, <em>Los Angeles Times Book Review</em><p></p><br>"Kevin Kenny has certainly done historical justice to his fascinating, if elusive, topic...[O]ne should salute a scholar who takes on a controversial subject and, with sober mastery, rips off the veils of legend."--Michael Kazin, <em>Washington Post Book World</em><p></p><br>"A convincing and well-written book, Kenny's work clearly establishes the ways and means used to 'demonize' the Molly Maguires and through them the Irish and trade union movement...He 'makes sense' of the Molly Maguires and, in doing so, the economic, social, and political forces surrounding them...He opens a new and rich perspective on a well-known event."--Robert D. Sampson for <em>H-Labor</em><p></p><br>"This is a thorough examination of the role of the Molly Maguires in the bitter struggle of working people to attain justice in 19th-Century USA and an incisive expose of the ruthless methods employed against all efforts to organize labor...It would be especially useful in a course that studies American resistance movements."--Anthony Garavente, California State University<p></p><br>"[Kenny] has made sense of the Molly Maguires and...all historians of both American labour and Irish rural protest are in his debt. He has written a fine book."--<em>Saothar</em><p></p><br>"[The book] is a fascinating and compelling study which not alone contains a vivid account of the Molly Maguires, but also incorporates a sustained interpretation of the origins, ideology and broader importance of this shadowy grouping."--<em>Immigrants and Minorities</em><p></p><br>"Seldom have I read a book that does a better job than this one of unraveling popular mythology and clearing away the ambiguities surrounding a conplex and contentious topic. That it grew directly out of the author's Ph.D. thesis and will almost certainly be considered the standard work on the question for some time to come makes it all the more impressive."--<em>Journal of American Ethnic History</em><p></p><br>"The definitive word on the Molly Maguires...thoroughly researched and neatly balanced...Kenny has assimilated and built on a century of scholarship. His excavation beneath the mythical qualities of the Molly Maguires is likely to be the standard work for some time."--<em>Errata</em><p></p><br>"[A] well-balanced and well-researched study which substantially increases our understanding of this legendary group."--<em>Pennsylvania History</em><p></p><br></p><h2>Communication: A Critical/Cultural Introduction</h2><p><strong>Communication: A Critical/Cultural Introduction, Second Edition</strong> introduces communication, from intimate and interpersonal to the public and mediated, as cultural.&nbsp; Using contemporary critical theory, authors John T.

And even if you do something about it, they don&#x2019;t expect it to last. <br><br>Well, we do.<br><br>This is a different kind of teen book. Check online or walk through your local bookstore. You&#x2019;ll find plenty of books written by forty-somethings who, like, totally understand what it&#x2019;s like being a teenager. You&#x2019;ll find a lot of cheap, throwaway books for teens, because young people today aren&#x2019;t supposed to care much about books, or see any reason to keep them around. And you&#x2019;ll find a wide selection of teen books where you never have to read anything twice&#x2013;because it&#x2019;s been dumbed down. Like, just for you. <br><br>What you&#x2019;re holding in your hands right now is a challenging, hardcover book for<i> </i>teens <i>by</i> two teens who believe our generation is ready for something different. Ready for something that doesn&#x2019;t promise you a whole new life if you&#x2019;ll just buy the right brand of jeans or use the right kind of deodorant. We believe our generation of young people is ready to rethink what teens are capable of, and what the teen years are all about. And we&#x2019;ve noticed that once some wrong ideas are debunked and cleared away, our generation is quick to choose a better way, even if it&#x2019;s also more difficult. <br><br>Our teen years have been different than most, even radically so. We&#x2019;re 19-year-old twin brothers, born and raised in Oregon, taught at home by our parents, and striving to follow Christ while making more than our share of mistakes. Strangely enough, we&#x2019;ve also served as interns at the Supreme Court of Alabama at 16, as grassroots directors for four statewide political campaigns at 17, and as authors of the most popular Christian teen blog on the web at 18. We&#x2019;ve spoken to thousands of teens and parents at our conferences in the United States and internationally and reached millions online.<br><br>Some might think our experiences would make us unable to relate to the average teenager. But that doesn&#x2019;t really bother us because we don&#x2019;t believe average teenagers exist. We&#x2019;ve witnessed the ideas in this book transform &#x201c;normal&#x201d; teens into world-changers, and we&#x2019;ve seen small handfuls of teens just like you accomplish incredible things when they&#x2019;re willing to break the mold of what society says their capable of.<br><br>So the story starts with us, but it&#x2019;s really not about us. It&#x2019;s about something God is doing in the hearts and minds of our generation. We call it a teenage rebellion against low expectations. It&#x2019;s an exciting movement that is changing the attitudes and actions of teens around the world. And we want you to be part of it.<br><br>This book explores a few simple but far-reaching questions:<br>� Is it possible that even though many teens today have more freedom than any other generation in history, we&#x2019;re actually missing out on some of the best years of our lives?<br>� Is it possible that everything our culture tells us about the purpose and potential of the teen years is a lie, and that we are its victims?<br>� Is it possible that our teen years actually represent a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to accomplish something huge&#x2013;both for ourselves and for our generation?<br>� And finally, what would our lives look like if we set out on a different path entirely&#x2013;a path that required more effort but promised a lot more reward, and ultimately, a lot more fun?<br><br>We describe that alternative path with three simple words: Do Hard Things.<br><br><b>What We Don&#x2019;t Mean<br></b>On the outskirts of a small town in Germany is the abbey of Dundelhoff. This small stone monastery is home to a particularly strict (and fictitious) sect of Dundress Monks who have each vowed to live a life of continual self-denial and discomfort. <br><br>Instead of wearing comfy t-shirts and well-worn jeans like most people, their clothing is either itchy shirts made from hair or painful chain mail worn directly over bare skin. Instead of a soft mattress, plush pillows, and warm blankets they choose to sleep on the cold stone floors of the abbey with not so much as a towel. You might remember reading somewhere that monks are fabulous cooks? Well, that might be true generally, but not about these monks. They eat colorless, tasteless sludge once a day. They drink only lukewarm water.<br><br>We could go on, but you get the picture. No matter what decision they face, Dundress Monks will always choose the more difficult option&#x2013;the one that provides the least physical comfort, the least appeal, the least fun. Why? Because they believe that the more miserable they are, the holier they are; and the holier they are, the happier God is.<br><br>Which makes these miserable monks the poster boys for <i>Do Hard Things</i>. Right? <br><br>Wrong! <br><br>If you&#x2019;re like most people, your first reaction to the idea of &#x201c;do hard things&#x201d; is something along the lines of, &#x201c;<i>Hard...,</i>&#x201d; you think nervously. &#x201c;<i>Guys, I might need to be somewhere else right about now.</i>&#x201d;<br><br>We understand your reaction. But we&#x2019;re not undercover monks plotting to make your life miserable. We&#x2019;re not recommending that you do just anything that&#x2019;s hard. For example, we&#x2019;re not telling you to rob a bank, jump off a cliff, climb Half Dome with your bare hands, or stand on your head for 24 hours straight. And we&#x2019;re certainly not telling you to work harder so you can earn God&#x2019;s favor.<br><br>But here&#x2019;s what we <i>are </i>doing. We are challenging our peers to grab hold of a much better option than what the world is offering. It&#x2019;s an option that has somehow gotten lost in our culture <i>and most people don&#x2019;t even know it.</i> But we don&#x2019;t just want to tell you, we want to show you. In the pages ahead you&#x2019;re going to meet young people just like you who have rediscovered this better way&#x2013;to reach higher, dream bigger, grow stronger, love and honor God, live with more joy&#x2013;and quit wasting their lives. <br><br>That&#x2019;s the short version of what we mean by doing hard things.<br><br>Don&#x2019;t think of this book as a collection of nice opinions. Think of it more as an invitation to a revolution you don&#x2019;t want to miss. In <i>Do Hard Things, </i>we not only say there is a better way to do the teen years, we show you how we and thousands of other teens are doing it right now&#x2013;and how you can as well.<br><br>[Excerpt taken from <i>Do Hard Things</i> Manuscript - not final]<br><i>From the Hardcover edition.</i></p><h2>For the Roses</h2><p>Discovered as a baby and raised by four urchin boys, Mary Rose Clayborne remains fiercely loyal to her misfit family until an English lord reveals a shocking secret that sends her into a confrontation with her past.</p><p>Mary Rose Clayborne is as well-protected by her four adoptive brothers as any woman in Blue Belle, Montana could be--until Lord Harrison Stanford MacDonald comes to town and she finds herself falling in love. How can Mary Rose keep her family together and learn to accept Harrison&#39;s questionable past? This story of love and adventure in the Old West will keep you turning the pages.No one ever knew what kind of strays, from animals to weary travelers, Mary Rose Clayborne would bring home next. Sometimes her four brothers&#x2039; runaway slave Adam, ax-pickpocket Douglas, gunslinger Cole, and con man Travis -- wondered whether her boarding school education did a lick of good now that their beautiful, impulsive little sister was back in Blue Belle, Montana. <p>Of course, everyone in town knew better than to mess with the Claybornes. The brothers, four of the toughest hombres in the West, had once been a mismatched gang of street urchins. But they had found an abandoned baby girl in a New York City alley, named her Mary Rose, headed West, and raised her to be a lady. Through the years the Claybornes had become a family, held together by loyalty and love if not by blood -- when they suddenly faced the crisis that could tear them apart. </p><p>That crisis came to town with Lord Harrison Stanford MacDonald. In his fine clothes, he looked every inch a dude. Mary Rose figured that if she didn't interfere, this handsome Englishman would get himself killed, so she took him home to the Clayborne ranch to ask her brothers to turn him into a cowboy. She didn't suspect MacDonald was a chameleon, not the greenhorn he appeared to be. He'd prove fast with a gun, quick with his fists, and capable of commanding the Claybornes's respect -- if not their trust. He'd also soon be desperately in love with Mary Rose. She returned his affection blissfully and wholeheartedly...until MacDonald revealed a secret that challenged everything she believed about her love, herself, and her life. </p><p>Now Mary Rose's search for identity and meaning would begin, sending her to England, to the family she lost long ago. Her soul hungered for the freedom of the American West, but she was being drawn away from all she cared about by the need to know her past...and by her uncertain but still potent love for MacDonald. Torn between conflicting loyalties, Mary Rose wasn't sure who she really was, or where she belonged...questions that could only be answered if she listened to the truth within her heart.</p></p><h2>Math in Focus: Singapore Math: Assessments Grade 3</h2><p>Math in Focus presents the Singapore approach to math in a way that is easy to use and understand.

On top of that, the economic growth imperative inherent in the present global monetary system is a main driver of global warming and other environmental crises.</p> <p><em>The End of Money and the Future of Civilization</em> demystifies the subjects of money, banking, and finance by tracing historical landmarks and important evolutionary shifts that have changed the essential nature of money. Greco&#x2019;s masterful work lays out the problems and then looks to the future for a next stage in money&#x2019;s evolution that can liberate us as individuals and communities from the current grip of centralized and politicized money power.</p> <p>Greco provides specific design proposals and exchange-system architectures for local, regional, national, and global financial systems. He offers strategies for their implementation and outlines actions grassroots organizations, businesses, and governments will need to take to achieve success.</p> <p>Ultimately, <em>The End of Money and the Future of Civilization</em> provides the necessary understanding&#x2014; for entrepreneurs, activists, and civic leaders&#x2014;to implement approaches toward monetary liberation. These approaches would empower communities, preserve democratic institutions, and begin to build economies that are sustainable, democratic, and insulated from the financial crises that plague the dominant monetary system.</p></p><p><p>Thomas H.

Greco details the abuses inherent in the widely misconstrued concept of 'legal tender,' and helps us understand the real roots of the current meltdown. He then offers unique tools for creating workable, enduring solutions. His story is compelling, and his lucid, accessible style makes it a rewarding read.

How can so few control and impoverish so many? Currency systems are an important source of this centralized power.

There can be no question about it--Tom Greco is the pit bull of the alternative currency movement."<strong>--Catherine Austin Fitts, Solari Investment Advisory Services, LLC</strong><br> <br> </p><br><br><p>"I have found Tom Greco to be a trusted and authoritative source of wisdom on the topics of the flaws in mainstream money and of the possibilities for alternatives. Even after years of garnering wisdom from Tom for my work with Toronto Dollars, his advice in this new book reaches a higher level of clarity and practicality."<strong>--Joy Kogawa, cofounder, Toronto Dollar</strong><br> <br> </p><br><br><p>"Our world is moving to increasing and dominant usage of distributed networks, and the associated peer-to-peer dynamics of people aggregating around the construction of common value. We have the communication infrastructure, but we still need to build robust peer-to-peer energy grids, AND, just as important, we need to be able to create peer-to-peer currencies that strengthen resilient communities in the context of turbulent globalization. To undertake the latter task, one voice has been consistently investigating what determines success and failure regarding the social production of money. That voice is Thomas Greco, who not only offers the definitive book on the subject, but offers also the condensation of a whole life of research and engagement with the topic. The time of crying in the wilderness is over for Thomas Greco: this is the age where these ideas will be practically implemented.

This gripping blend of theory and practicality lays out all the options for creating saner money and credit systems--and the real possibilities in today's information age of electronic trading and exchange, at last, without the need to use money at all."<strong>--Hazel Henderson, author of <em>Ethical Markets</em> and President of Ethical Markets Media (USA/Brazil)</strong><br> <br> </p><br><br><p>"If there is one thing people everywhere should drop everything to learn right now it is how the money system works, why it is failing and what to do to survive and even thrive. The reason they don't is because it has been so difficult to get and to understand this information. Against all odds, Tom Greco has filled this important need with an easy read including the most practical advice for getting you through the crisis into a more secure, healthier and happier future."<strong>--Elisabet Sahtouris, Ph.D., evolution biologist; futurist; author of <em>EarthDance: Living Systems in Evolution</em></strong><br> <br> </p><br><br><p>"For those who would survive the sustainable cynicism of monopoly capital, now that the usurpers are caught red-handed and the mask of democracy has slipped, Greco provides the tools for regeneration of societies.

Showcasing Green's verve and style, <i>The Leavenworth Case</i> opens with the shocking murder of Horatio Leavenworth, a wealthy New York merchant, philanthropist, and well-known member of the community. His favorite niece, Mary, is to inherit his fortune, and all of the evidence seems to implicate her or her sister. Yet surprises greet Gryce at every turn-even before the second murder.<br><br>For more than seventy years, Penguin has been the leading publisher of classic literature in the English-speaking world.

He has written for many periodicals, from the <i>Washington Post</i> to <i>New Statesman</i>.First published in 1878, nine years before the debut of Sherlock Holmes in <i>A Study in Scarlet</i>, this atmospheric and suspenseful mystery well deserves a modern audience. When someone shoots Horatio Leavenworth, a wealthy retired merchant, through the head in his library late one night, the evidence at the inquest indicates that no one could have left the victim's locked Manhattan mansion before the discovery of the body the next morning. Suspicion thus falls on members of the household, specifically the dead man's nieces, Mary and Eleanore, only one of whom stands to benefit from their uncle's death. Everett Raymond, a junior partner in a New York law firm that had Leavenworth as a client, teams with unassuming official investigator Ebenezer Gryce to seek the truth. Green (1846&#x2013;1935), whose smooth prose remains fresh, makes Gryce an interesting enough character to leave fans of traditional whodunits eager to see more of the detective in reissues of his further exploits. <i>(May)</i> <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

This book highlights major concepts that organize the diverse work in this field: Knowledges, Identities, Equalities, Bodies, Places, and Representations. Its focus on "the everyday" speaks to the importance this book places on students understanding the taken-for granted circumstances of their daily lives. Precisely because it is not the same for everyone, the everyday becomes the ideal location for cultivating students&#x2019; intellectual capacities as well as their political investigations and interventions. In addition to exploring each concept in detail, each chapter includes up to five short recently published readings that illuminate an aspect of that concept. <i>Everyday Women&#x2019;s and Gender Studies </i>explores the idea that "People are different, and the world isn&#x2019;t fair," and engages students in the inevitably complicated follow-up question, "Now that we know, how shall we live?"</p></p><p><p><strong>Ann Braithwaite</strong> is Professor and Coordinator of Diversity and Social Justice Studies at the University of Prince Edward Island.

By focusing on key concepts and not star theorists, ordinary life and not iconic examples, this book provides a welcome and innovative introduction to the twisted and all-too-everpresent ways in which gender exerts itself on our bodies, our minds, our ideas, our identities. A welcome addition to the literature!</p> <p>--Suzanna Walters, Northeastern University</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p><em>Everyday Women's and Gender Studies</em> is an extremely welcome addition to the textbook landscape. Organized around key concepts rather than historical moments or cultural trajectories, it introduces students to the shifting, varied, and complicated discipline that is women&#x2019;s and gender studies.

In their organization by "concepts" rather than the conventional theoretical positions, historical periods, or cultural contexts, they succeed not only in providing information, but, importantly, modeling the field&#x2019;s evolution through interrogating the very idea of how we come to know, and what we do with that knowledge. A must for every student and instructor both in and outside of Women's and Gender Studies!</p> <p>--Sri Craven, Portland State University</p> <p>This innovative textbook speaks directly to students and unpacks the knowledges, identities, bodies, representations, and places that motivate feminist pedagogy in women&#x2019;s, gender, and sexualities studies (WGSS). Rarely have I seen a text that helps students imagine and then explore how&nbsp;WGSS is put together in theoretical and practical terms. The transparency and clarity of the text is impressive.

Challenging predictable origin stories and disciplinary basics, the volume offers an accessible approach to the field even as it destabilizes its most stubborn dogmas.

It has been cited as one of the seminal works of fiction of the 20th century and is studied in colleges and universities across the Western world. The story begins with a traveling salesman, Gregor Samsa, waking to find himself transformed (metamorphosed) into a large, monstrous insect-like creature. The cause of Samsa&#39;s transformation is never revealed, and Kafka himself never gave an explanation. The rest of Kafka&#39;s novella deals with Gregor&#39;s attempts to adjust to his new condition as he deals with being burdensome to his parents and sister, who are repulsed by the horrible, verminous creature Gregor has become.</p><p>Since his death in 1924, Kafka has come to be regarded as one of the greatest modern writers, one whose work brilliantly explores the anxiety, futility, and complexity of modern life. The precision and clarity of Kafka's style, its powerful symbolism, and his existential exploration of the human condition have given his work universal significance. <br>In addition to the title selection, considered by many critics Kafka's most perfect work, this collection includes "The Judgment," "In the Penal Colony," "A Country Doctor," and "A Report to an Academy."

Because Tony Hayter teaches and conducts research at a premier engineering school, he is in touch with engineers daily and understands their vocabulary. This leads to a clear and more readable writing style that students understand and appreciate. Additionally, because of his intimacy with the professional community, Hayter includes many high-interest examples and datasets that keep students&#39; attention throughout the term. PROBABILITY AND STATISTICS FOR ENGINEERS AND SCIENTISTS employs a flexible approach with regard to the use of computer tools. Because the book is not tied to a particular software package, instructors may choose the program that best suits their needs. However, the book does provide substantial computer output (using MINITAB and other programs) to give students the necessary practice in interpreting output. &#34;Computer Note&#34; sections offer tips for using various software packages to perform analysis of the datasets, which can be downloaded from the website. Through the use of extensive examples and datasets, the book illustrates the importance of statistical data collection and analysis for students in the fields of aerospace, biochemical, civil, electrical, environmental, industrial, mechanical, and textile engineering, as well as for students in physics, chemistry, computing, biology, management, and mathematics.</p><p>1.

The book continues to help students make sense of a complex world in transition and explains how globalization became part of public discourse. Filled with case studies, this text makes the intricacies of globalization concrete, meaningful, and clear for students and moves them away from simple social evolutionary views, encouraging them to connect social change, development policies, global inequalities and social movements. The book challenges students to see themselves as global citizens whose consumption decisions have real social and ecological implications.</p><p><b>Philip McMichael</b> grew up in Adelaide, South Australia, and is an International Professor of Development Sociology at Cornell University.

A car accident, an earthquake or flood, being attacked by a dog, undergoing a frightening medical treatment?all are distinctly different events yet all provoke common symptoms of psychological trauma. These symptoms may include fearfulness, nightmares, and dramatic behavioral or personality changes. And parental anxiety over changes in a child can, in turn, complicate the healing process.<br> <br> Children and Trauma teaches parents and professionals about the effects of such ordeals on children and offers a blueprint for restoring a child's sense of safety and balance. Cynthia Monahon, a child psychologist who specializes in the treatment of psychological trauma, offers hope and reassurance for parents. She suggests straightforward ways to help kids through tough times, and also describes in detail the warning signs that indicate a child needs professional help. Monahon helps adults understand psychological trauma from a child's point of view and explores the ways both parents and professionals can help children heal.</p><p>CYNTHIA MONAHON is director of a children&#39;s mental health clinic in Northampton, Massachusetts."An invaluable guide for parents of the thousands of children traumatized each year by disasters, accidents, or violence." --Susan Kelley, R.N., Ph.D., Boston College School of Nursing<br> <br> "Parents reading this sensitive, comprehensive book will be well nourished . . . wrapped in a warm comforter, soothed, educated, and given the hope and practical advice they need to help their children and themselves cope with traumatizing experiences.

In <i>Money Changes Everything</i>, leading financial historian William Goetzmann argues the exact opposite&#x2015;that the development of finance has made the growth of civilizations possible. Goetzmann explains that finance is a time machine, a technology that allows us to move value forward and backward through time; and that this innovation has changed the very way we think about and plan for the future. He shows how finance was present at key moments in history: driving the invention of writing in ancient Mesopotamia, spurring the classical civilizations of Greece and Rome to become great empires, determining the rise and fall of dynasties in imperial China, and underwriting the trade expeditions that led Europeans to the New World. He also demonstrates how the apparatus we associate with a modern economy&#x2015;stock markets, lines of credit, complex financial products, and international trade&#x2015;were repeatedly developed, forgotten, and reinvented over the course of human history.</p><p>Exploring the critical role of finance over the millennia, and around the world, Goetzmann details how wondrous financial technologies and institutions&#x2015;money, bonds, banks, corporations, and more&#x2015;have helped urban centers to expand and cultures to flourish. And it's not done reshaping our lives, as Goetzmann considers the challenges we face in the future, such as how to use the power of finance to care for an aging and expanding population.</p><p><i>&nbsp; Money Changes Everything</i> presents a fascinating look into the way that finance has steered the course of history.</p></p><p><p>"Only William Goetzmann--an archaeologist, art historian, and esteemed finance scholar--could have produced this masterful exploration of money and investing through the ages. <i>Money Changes Everything</i> is at once deep, broad, sweeping, and gorgeously illustrated. It is a book that readers will savor and refer to again and again."<b>--William Bernstein, author of <i>A Splendid Exchange: How Trade Shaped the World</i></b></p><p>"Money is the greatest invention since the wheel. In this masterwork, <i>Money Changes Everything</i>, William Goetzmann traces money's role from prehistoric times to the present, showing how civilizations developed on a bedrock of financial transactions. A beautifully written and compelling book."<b>--Elroy Dimson, University of Cambridge and London Business School</b></p><p>"In <i>Money Changes Everything</i>, readers learn a tremendous amount about the core ideas of finance. William Goetzmann uses a vast range of historical examples to explain why the evolution of finance and civilization are inseparable."<b>--Robert J. Shiller, Nobel Laureate in Economics</b></p><p>"In this engaging book, William Goetzmann, a modern Renaissance man, demonstrates that throughout recorded history, the power of financial technologies has improved human existence. Like other technologies, financial innovations can sometimes be disruptive. Goetzmann, however, shows us that much of the time, these innovations propel economic progress and expand individual opportunities."<b>--Richard Sylla, Stern School of Business, New York University</b></p><p>"If anyone had told me that someone could write coherently and intelligently about Karl Marx, cuneiform tablets, the South Sea bubble, the opium trade, and David's painting <i>Death of Marat</i> between a single set of covers, I would have shaken my head in disbelief. This book accomplishes precisely this. <i>Money Changes Everything</i> does nothing less than to think through the contribution of finance to modern civilization. A thrilling read."<b>--Hans-Joachim Voth, University of Zurich</b></p><p>"Ranging from early civilizations to the present day and moving from the Fertile Crescent to our current global society, this book contains a wealth of interesting observations about the history of finance. Readers will be attracted by the genial tone and tales of personal discovery."<b>--Peter Temin, Massachusetts Institute of Technology</b></p><p>"This is a long-term history of the development and importance of financial technologies and institutions.

Focusing on the immense photographic output of the Salpetriere hospital, the notorious Parisian asylum for insane and incurable women, Didi-Huberman shows the crucial role played by photography in the invention of the category of hysteria. Under the direction of the medical teacher and clinician Jean-Martin Charcot, the inmates of Salpetriere identified as hysterics were methodically photographed, providing skeptical colleagues with visual proof of hysteria's specific form. These images, many of which appear in this book, provided the materials for the multivolume album <i>Iconographie photographique de la Salpetriere</i>.</p><p>As Didi-Huberman shows, these photographs were far from simply objective documentation. The subjects were required to portray their hysterical "type"&#x2015;they performed their own hysteria. Bribed by the special status they enjoyed in the purgatory of experimentation and threatened with transfer back to the inferno of the incurables, the women patiently posed for the photographs and submitted to presentations of hysterical attacks before the crowds that gathered for Charcot's "Tuesday Lectures."</p><p>Charcot did not stop at voyeuristic observation. Through techniques such as hypnosis, electroshock therapy, and genital manipulation, he instigated the hysterical symptoms in his patients, eventually giving rise to hatred and resistance on their part. Didi-Huberman follows this path from complicity to antipathy in one of Charcot's favorite "cases," that of Augustine, whose image crops up again and again in the <i>Iconographie</i>. Augustine's virtuosic performance of hysteria ultimately became one of self-sacrifice, seen in pictures of ecstasy, crucifixion, and silent cries.</p></p><p>"The invention and dissemination of photography, it has often been noted, contributed to what has been called the modern 'frenzy of the visible.' In this remarkable study of Charcot's clinic Salp�tri�re and its iconography of madness, Georges Didi-Huberman demonstrates that it led as well to the heightened visibility of frenzy. The camera, he brilliantly shows, documented -- or, better put, solicited -- the theatricalized spectacle of hysterical symptoms suffered by women at the dawn of the psychoanalytic age." <br>--Martin Jay, Sidney Hellman Ehrman Professor of History, University of California, Berkeley <p>"Georges Didi-Huberman's *Invention of Hysteria* is an almost legendary text, so influential has it been on cultural criticism, and this even before its very welcome translation into English. Written in a style that is at once literary and philosophical, Didi-Huberman brilliantly demonstrates how a study of hysteria in the nineteenth century continues to have profound relevance for anyone interested in questions of culture and its embodiment -- that is, questions concerning the workings of power. The author's erudite combination of visual and textual research and provocative analysis has produced a book that will be equally crucial to scholars of medicine, feminism, psychoanalysis, literature, photography, art history, the body, or postmodern theory, to name only a few of the fields it touches on. But it's also simply a great read, an artful rendition of history that reminds us of the extent to which the 'weird science' of the nineteenth century still haunts our thinking to this day." <br>--Geoffrey Batchen, Professor of Art History, City University of New York Graduate Center </p><p>"Van Gogh and hysteria? Proust and catalepsy! Sigmund Freud and theater? Charcot's influence is suddenly registering everywhere, not only in studies of fin-de-si�cle medicine and psychology, but also in aesthetics, philosophy, and photographic history. Charcot figures in reexaminations of the "new psychologies" of the 1890s, the birth of Freudian psychology, male and female hysteria, the designs of art nouveau lamp posts, art manifestos of the Symbolists, the novels of Huysmans and Proust, the landscapes of Van Gogh and Gauguin, and the history of flash photography. No wonder. The images of his patients at the infamous Salp�tri�re hospital in Paris strike a thoroughly contemporary and postmodern chord, one that is brilliantly brought to life in this remarkable book by Georges Didi-Huberman." <br>--Robert Sobieszek, Curator of Photography, Los Angeles County Museum of Art </p><p>"Didi-Huberman composes an absolutely fascinating story about the emergence of modern subjectivity from the netherworld and darkrooms of nineteenth-century medicine. This gorgeously written and provocative landmark study is indispensable for anyone interested in questions of gender, the history of science, photography, and medicine: in short, in how we see ourselves as who we are." <br>--Ulrich Baer, Department of German, New York University, author of *Spectral Evidence: The Photography of Trauma*</p>Georges Didi-Huberman, a philosopher and art historian based in Paris, teaches at the �cole des Hautes �tudes en Sciences Sociales. Recipient of the 2015 Adorno Prize, he is the author of more than fifty books on the history and theory of images, including <i>Invention of Hysteria: Charcot and the Photographic Iconography of the Salp�tri�re</i> (MIT Press), <i>Bark</i> (MIT Press), <i>Images in Spite of All: Four Photographs from Auschwitz</i>, and <i>The Surviving Image</i>: <i>Phantoms of Time and Time of Phantoms: Aby Warburg's History of Art</i>.</p><h2>When Truth Was Treason: German Youth against Hitler: The Story of the Helmuth Hubener(umlaut over the u) Group Based on the Narrative of Karl-Heinz Schnibbe</h2><p>A chilling, true story of four courageous teenagers who defied the Nazis. Based on a first-person account by one of the surviving conspirators, Karl-Heinz Schnibbe, a working-class son of the city of Hamburg, this book provides a vivid chronicle of the brave young men who faced the awful tyranny of a nation&#39;s darkest hour. 20 photos.</p><p>Text: English (translation)<br> Original Language: GermanFrom Publishers Weekly Early in WWII, four Hamburg members of the Hitler Youth who became disillusioned with the Nazi regime began writing and distributing leaflets revealing the Allies' version of the war, which they heard while covertly listening to the BBC. For this they were interrogated, tortured and tried. Three of the boys received long prison sentences; the leader, Helmut Hubener, 17, was guillotined. Based largely on the recollections of one of the surviving conspirators, this compelling and well-documented study offers a detailed account of the motivations and actions of this resistance group. Included in the text are contents of the leaflets, Hubener's confession at Gestapo headquarters and letters from the boys' parents asking the court for leniency. There is also an informative foreword on Mormonism in Hitler's Germany, since three of the boys were members of the Latter-Day Saints church. The editors teach at Brigham Young University, Holmes history and Keele German. Photos. Copyright 1995 Reed Business Information, Inc. --Publishers Weekly<br>From Library Journal In 1942, Helmuth Hubener, a 17-year-old from Hamburg and a member of the Church of the Latter Day Saints, listened to forbidden broadcasts from England and then typed up fliers that contradicted official Nazi information. The sheets were distributed by three other young men. For these acts, Hubener was beheaded and his friends received prison sentences ranging from four to ten years. Editors Holmes and Keele (history and German, respectively, Brigham Young University) have translated and edited the account of Karl-Heinz Schnibbe, the eldest of the young men sent to prison. The account takes the reader from Schnibbe's youngest days through his involvement with Hubener and his years in prison. The notes are an excellent source of information for students, though they should have been placed at the bottom of the main narrative. Schnibbe's account is powerful and adds to the literature on German resistance. The book should be in all academic and large public libraries.?Dennis L. Noble, Sequim, Wash.

They skillfully integrate several perspectives in order to help practitioners meet the challenges they will face in client assessment. A risk and resilience framework helps social workers understand environmental influences on the emergence of mental disorders and the strengths that clients already possess. Social workers will also learn to apply critical thinking to the DSM when it is inconsistent with social work values and principles. Finally, the authors catalog the latest evidence-based assessment instruments and treatments for each disorder so that social workers can intervene efficiently and effectively, using the best resources available.<br><br>Students and practitioners alike will appreciate the wealth of case examples, evidence-based assessment instruments, treatment plans, and new social diversity sections that make this an essential guide to the assessment and diagnostic processes in social work practice.</p><p><br>Jacqueline Corcoran, PhD, is Professor at Virginia Commonwealth University School of Social Work.<br><br>Joseph Walsh, PhD, is Professor at Virginia Commonwealth University School of Social Work.<br><br>."..a breath of fresh air...this volume does not limit its scope and succeeds admirably for it.

By the author of Reversible Error. 25,000 first printing. $25,000 ad/promo.</p><p><p><strong>Robert K. Tanenbaum</strong> is one of the country's most respected and successful trial lawyers. Previously, he was the homicide bureau chief for the New York District Attorney's Office and deputy chief counsel to the congressional committee investigations into the assassinations of John F. Kennedy and Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. He has taught advanced criminal procedure at the University of California, Berkeley, and conducts continuing legal education seminars in California, New York, and Pennsylvania. He is a <i>New York Times </i>bestselling author. Some of his works include <em>Outrage</em>, <em>Betrayed</em>, <em>Counterplay</em>, <em>Fury</em>, <em>Hoax</em>, and two true-crime books, <em>The Piano Teacher: The True Story of a Psychotic Killer </em>and <em>Badge of the Assassin.</em></p>Ex-New York DA Tanenbaum's gritty thrillers take full advantage of his own experience in the judicial system. Here he brings back NYC assistant DAs Butch Karp and Marlene Ciampi, last seen in No Lesser Plea , for a fifth go-round. Now married, they are expecting their first child. While Marlene is on pregnancy leave, Butch gets into a hassle with his superior and resigns from the DA's office. Unofficially, then, they become embroiled in a murder case in Queens, the shooting of a pro basketball star in a car whose glove compartment contains a large package of high-grade cocaine. The tangled case brings them into contact with Mafia hitmen and loan sharks, and includes revelations of point-shaving, arson-for-hire and a political corruption scheme that involves numerous high-ranking New York pols. In order to break the case, Karp ends up as the 12th man on a pro basketball team, a return to the injury-shortened athletic dreams of his college days, while Marlene trundles off to see a Jamaican druglord in Brooklyn. Tanenbaum knows his criminal procedure cold and is briskly efficient in propelling his complicated plot. Though the novel is generally laced with a nervy, street-smart cynicism, there are some absurdities: the idea of a 30-something lawyer on a pro hoops team is nothing less than preposterous, and it takes an equally unlikely coincidence to bring Marlene into the mortal danger that Tanenbaum concocts for her. These cavils aside, this is a consistently entertaining thriller.

The cultural context of <em>Anne of Green Gables</em> is explored through the writings of Carole Gerson, Kate Wood, and Mary Henley Rubio. &#x201c;Criticism&#x201d; is divided into &#x201c;Early Reviews and Responses&#x201d; and &#x201c;Modern Critical Views.&#x201d; Eight reviews from 1908 to 1942 include Canadian, American, and British assessments. Critical essays are provided by, among others, Northrop Frye, Elizabeth Epperly, T. D. MacLulich, Juliet McMaster, Carol Shields, Margaret Atwood, and Elizabeth Waterston. A Chronology and Selected Bibliography are also included.</p><p>When Marilla and Matthew Cuthbert of Green Gables, Prince Edward Island, send for a boy orphan to help them out at the farm, they are in no way prepared for the error that will change their lives. The mistake takes the shape of Anne Shirley, a redheaded 11-year-old girl who can talk anyone under the table. Fortunately, her sunny nature and quirky imagination quickly win over her reluctant foster parents. Anne's feisty spirit soon draws many friends--and much trouble--her way. Not a day goes by without some melodramatic new episode in the tragicomedy of her life. Early on, Anne declares her eternal antipathy for Gilbert Blythe, a classmate who commits the ultimate sin of mocking her hair color. Later, she accidentally dyes that same cursed hair green. Another time, in her haste to impress a new neighbor, she bakes a cake with liniment instead of vanilla. Lucy Maud Montgomery's series of books about Anne have remained classics since the early 20th century. Her portrayal of this feminine yet independent spirit has given generations of girls a strong female role model, while offering a taste of another, milder time in history. This lovely boxed gift collection comprises <i>Anne of Green Gables</i>, <i>Anne of the Island</i>, <i>Anne of Avonlea</i>, <i>Anne of Windy Poplars</i>, <i>Anne's House of Dreams</i>, <i>Anne of Ingleside</i>, <i>Rainbow Valley</i>, and <i>Rilla of Ingleside</i>.

This long-awaited book fills the need for a comprehensive textbook on contract theory suitable for use at the graduate and advanced undergraduate levels. It covers the areas of agency theory, information economics, and organization theory, highlighting common themes and methodologies and presenting the main ideas in an accessible way. It also presents many applications in all areas of economics, especially labor economics, industrial organization, and corporate finance. The book emphasizes applications rather than general theorems while providing self-contained, intuitive treatment of the simple models analyzed. In this way, it can also serve as a reference for researchers interested in building contract-theoretic models in applied contexts.The book covers all the major topics in contract theory taught in most graduate courses. It begins by discussing such basic ideas in incentive and information theory as screening, signaling, and moral hazard. Subsequent sections treat multilateral contracting with private information or hidden actions, covering auction theory, bilateral trade under private information, and the theory of the internal organization of firms; long-term contracts with private information or hidden actions; and incomplete contracts, the theory of ownership and control, and contracting with externalities. Each chapter ends with a guide to the relevant literature. Exercises appear in a separate chapter at the end of the book.</p></p><p>"An extremely impressive synthesis of the ideas that make up modern contract theory.

Together with the shorter recollections of James Edward's two sisters, Anna Lefroy and Caroline Austen, the Memoir remains the prime authority for her life and continues to inform all subsequent accounts. These are family memories, the record of Jane Austen's life shaped and limited by the loyalties, reserve, and affection of nieces and nephews recovering in old age the outlines of the young aunt they had each known.

In this revised and expanded version, child psychologist Jane Nelson (coauthor of the entire Positive Discipline series) teams up with speaker and therapist Lynn Lott and H. Stephen Glenn (<i>Raising Self-Reliant Children</i>). <i>Positive Discipline</i> is based on the theories of child development expert Rudolf Dreikurs, and uses communication, consistency, and specific techniques (such as the four-step follow-through method, taking time for training, giving age-appropriate chores to teach responsibility, and using positive time-outs in which the child takes some time with a calming activity) to help children develop the life skills they need to be "effective, happy, contributing, and respectful members of the family and society."<p> The first part of the text provides an introduction to the concept of positive discipline and its tools. The second part of the book is an alphabetical breakdown of more than 100 child-rearing topics, from addiction to zits--including cruelty to animals, fairness, laundry, negative children, pampering, self-esteem, tattling, whining, and much more.

De Quincey describes the intense &#x201c;pleasures&#x201d; and harrowing &#x201c;pains&#x201d; of his opium use in lyrical and dramatic prose. A notorious success since its 1821 publication, the work has been an important influence on philosophers, theorists, and psychologists, as well as literary writers, of the nineteenth and twentieth centuries. But <em>Confessions</em> is only one part of a larger confessional project conceived by De Quincey over the course of his writing career. Gathered together in this edition, these texts provide a fascinating glimpse of early nineteenth-century British aesthetic, medical, psychological, political, philosophical, social, racial, national, and imperialist attitudes. </p> <p> This edition includes the 1821 text of Confessions, its important sequel <em>Suspiria de Profundis</em> (1845), and <em>its</em> sequel, <em>The English Mail-Coach</em> (1849), as well as extensive appendices. </p></p><p><p> <strong>Joel Faflak</strong> is Associate Professor of English at the University of Western Ontario. </p><p> &#x201c;Joel Faflak&#x2019;s new edition of <em>Confessions of an English Opium-Eater</em> finally does justice to a work too often celebrated for its eccentricity rather than importance. Immersing this strange memoir fully in the historical milieu that produced it, Faflak proves De Quincey to be a keen critic of culture as well as an intrepid explorer of the mind. The Introduction sketches De Quincey&#x2019;s life, work, and significance with sagacity and wit. But the chief glory of this edition is its unflinching discussion of the history of opium as anodyne. Marshalling a wide array of primary material, Faflak reveals how eating opium&#x2015;and writing about it&#x2015;can be an activity rife with cultural implications and philosophical possibilities. De Quincey&#x2019;s <em>Confessions</em> and related writings come alive for today&#x2019;s readers in this edition.&#x201d; &#x2015; Paul Youngquist, Pennsylvania State University </p> <p> &#x201c;This is by far the best paperback edition of De Quincey&#x2019;s <em>Confessions</em> ever to be published. Joel Faflak&#x2019;s comprehensive introduction demonstrates both why De Quincey is fascinatingly of our own moment, and how he speaks to the complex interplay between the literary avant-garde and imperialist geopolitics during the early nineteenth century. The text is thoroughly annotated and its abundant allusions explained. Especially useful are the appendices that locate the <em>Confessions</em> in literary, social, and political history, illuminating the role played by the opium trade in Britain&#x2019;s colonial mission, as well as how opium use was understood in the medical literature of the time. Faflak&#x2019;s expert editing gives us a De Quincey who is richer and stranger than ever before.&#x201d; &#x2015; Margaret Russett, University of Southern California </p></p><h2>Noah Webster&#39;s Advice to the Young and Moral Catechism</h2><p>This book contains two historical reprints which Founder Noah Webster wrote to enlighten the minds of youth in religious and moral principles and restrain some of the common vices of our country.

Starting with his seminal 1964 study on creativity up to his 2010 publication in <i>Newsweek</i>, the volume spans over four decades of research and writing and clearly shows Csikszentmihalyi&#x2019;s own development as an academic, psychologist, researcher and person. Unconventional and unorthodox in his approach, Csikszentmihalyi chose the topic of creativity as a field of study believing it would help him be a better psychologist and advance his understanding of how to live a better life.</p><p>The chapters in this volume trace the history of the study of creativity back to the days of Guilford and research on IQ and Jacob Getzels&#x2019; work on creativity and intelligence. Firmly grounded in that history, yet extending it in new directions, Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi started his life-long study on artistic creativity. His first extensive study at the School of the Art Institute of Chicago enabled him to observe, test and interview fine art students drawing in a studio. The study formed the very basis of all his work on the subject and has resulted in several articles, represented in this volume, on such creativity-related concepts as problem solving versus problem finding, the personality of the artist, the influence of the social context, creativity as a social construction, developmental issues and flow. The main contribution to the topic of creativity and also the main concept explored in this volume, is the Systems Model of Creativity. Seven chapters in this volume discuss the development of this conceptual model and theory.</p></p><p>A Hungarian psychology professor, who emigrated to the United States at the age of 22.

Surely, theoretical physicists are immune to mere trends, dogmatic beliefs, or flights of fancy? In fact, acclaimed physicist and bestselling author Roger Penrose argues that researchers working at the extreme frontiers of physics are just as susceptible to these forces as anyone else. In this provocative book, he argues that fashion, faith, and fantasy, while sometimes productive and even essential in physics, may be leading today's researchers astray in three of the field's most important areas&#x2015;string theory, quantum mechanics, and cosmology.</p><p>Arguing that string theory has veered away from physical reality by positing six extra hidden dimensions, Penrose cautions that the fashionable nature of a theory can cloud our judgment of its plausibility. In the case of quantum mechanics, its stunning success in explaining the atomic universe has led to an uncritical faith that it must also apply to reasonably massive objects, and Penrose responds by suggesting possible changes in quantum theory. Turning to cosmology, he argues that most of the current fantastical ideas about the origins of the universe cannot be true, but that an even wilder reality may lie behind them. Finally, Penrose describes how fashion, faith, and fantasy have ironically also shaped his own work, from twistor theory, a possible alternative to string theory that is beginning to acquire a fashionable status, to "conformal cyclic cosmology," an idea so fantastic that it could be called "conformal crazy cosmology."</p><p>The result is an important critique of some of the most significant developments in physics today from one of its most eminent figures.</p></p><p><p>"This gem of a book is vintage Roger Penrose: eloquently argued and deeply original on every page. His perspective on the present crisis and future promise of physics and cosmology provides an important corrective to fashionable thinking at this crucial moment in science. This book deserves the widest possible hearing among specialists and the public alike."<b>--Lee Smolin, author of <i>Time Reborn: From the Crisis in Physics to the Future of the Universe</i></b></p><b>Roger Penrose</b>, one the world's foremost theoretical physicists, has won numerous prizes, including the Albert Einstein Medal, for his fundamental contributions to general relativity and cosmology.

But thanks to new discoveries by Gerard Milburn and other cutting-edge scientists, quantum computing is about to become a reality.In this book, the first one for the general public to explain the scientific ideas behind concepts seen before only in science fiction, physicist Milburn brings us the exciting world of phenomena of entanglement, where particles can be in two places at the same time, where matter on the quantum level can be teleported � la Star Trek&#39;s famous Transporter; and where cryptographers can construct fundamentally unbreakable computer codes.Although other books and magazine articles have dealt with some of the subjects in this book, this is the first book for the layman to deal specifically with quantum computing, an area pioneered by the great physicist Richard Feynman, who first posed the challenge to scientists to devise the smallest, fastest computer elements, to take us to the absolute physical limits of computers.

And what is this obsession with food except a struggle between sin and virtue, overeating and self-control--a struggle with the fierce temptations of gluttony. <br> In <em>Gluttony</em>, Francine Prose serves up a marvelous banquet of witty and engaging observations on this most delicious of deadly sins. She traces how our notions of gluttony have evolved along with our ideas about salvation and damnation, health and illness, life and death. Offering a lively smorgasbord that ranges from Augustine's <em>Confessions</em> and Chaucer's <em>Pardoner's Tale</em>, to Petronius's <em>Satyricon</em> and Dante's <em>Inferno</em>, she shows that gluttony was in medieval times a deeply spiritual matter, but today we have transformed gluttony from a sin into an illness--it is the horrors of cholesterol and the perils of red meat that we demonize. Indeed, the modern take on gluttony is that we overeat out of compulsion, self-destructiveness, or to avoid intimacy and social contact. But gluttony, Prose reminds us, is also an affirmation of pleasure and of passion. She ends the book with a discussion of M.F.K. Fisher's idiosyncratic defense of one of the great heroes of gluttony, Diamond Jim Brady, whose stomach was six times normal size. <br> "The broad, shiny face of the glutton," Prose writes, "has been--and continues to be--the mirror in which we see ourselves, our hopes and fears, our darkest dreams and deepest desires." Never have we delved more deeply into this mirror than in this insightful and stimulating book.<br></p><p><br><strong>Francine Prose's</strong> many works include <em>Blue Angel, The Lives of the Muses</em>, and, most recently, <em>Caravaggio: Painter of Miracles</em>. She is a contributing editor at <em>Harper's</em> and writes on art for <em>The Wall Street Journal</em>.<br>Seven writers have been invited to consider the seven deadly sins, and the results are being published in a promising series of small, cleverly illustrated, and, so far, scintillating volumes.<p> Epstein's recent book on snobbery has met with great acclaim, making him uniquely suited to the task of analyzing envy, since snobbery is based on its cultivation, and, indeed, Epstein is a witty and thoughtful elucidator of this covert and poisonous state of mind. Of the seven sins, Epstein observes, envy is the most common and insidious and the least enjoyable. He discusses various types of envy, the differences between women's and men's envy, Freud's preoccupation with it, and worlds in which envy rages (the arts and academia may be the worst). Epstein confesses to his own struggles with envy over the course of his musings, which grow in gravitas as he moves beyond individuals to consider how envy between nations leads to war and how anti-Semitism can be interpreted as a particularly malignant manifestation of this deadly sin. </p><p>Novelist and critic Prose brings her keen interest in our conflicted relationship with our bodies to her creatively, even voraciously researched and elegantly argued inquiry into the paradoxes of gluttony, a sin writ large on the body and, therefore, impossible to conceal. Prose notes that the term is rarely used now that overeating is viewed as a psychological and health problem rather than a "crime against God." Equally conversant in religious and secular perspectives, Prose turns to theology and art to illuminate the curious history of a sin rooted in a behavior essential to survival. She traces the line between gourmandism and binging and ponders the increase in obesity in our consumer culture and the stigma of being overweight in a society that loves excess in everything but body size. Gluttons now sin against "prevailing standards of beauty and health," and the punishment is living hell. <i>Donna Seaman</i><br><i>Copyright � American Library Association.

We've gotten so used to sloppy generational analysis filled with dumb clich�s about young people that we've lost sight of what <i>really</i> unites Millennials. Namely:<br><br> - We are the most educated and hard-working generation in American history.<br><br> - We poured historic and insane amounts of time and money into preparing ourselves for the 21st century labor market.<br>- We have been taught to consider working for free (homework, internships) a privilege for our own benefit.<br><br>- We are poorer, more medicated, and more precariously employed than our parents, grandparents, even our great grandparents, with less of a social safety net to boot. <br><br> <i>Kids These Days,</i> is about why. In brilliant, crackling prose, early Wall Street occupier Malcolm Harris gets mercilessly real about our maligned birth cohort. Examining trends like runaway student debt, the rise of the intern, mass incarceration, social media, and more, Harris gives us a portrait of what it means to be young in America today that will wake you up and piss you off.<br><br> Millennials were the first generation raised explicitly as investments, Harris argues, and in <i>Kids These Days</i> he dares us to confront and take charge of the consequences now that we are grown up. <br><br></p><p><b>Malcolm Harris </b>is a freelance writer and an editor at <i>The New Inquiry</i>.

We have been sheltered by our parents, swindled by our universities, deadened by our therapists, and for all this our reward has been glib condescension from the boomer press. Rising to our defense is Harris, a familiar provocateur from the internet's left flank. Harris contends that America has stiffed our generation...He brings a fresh, contrarian eye to some of the usual data points...As generational advocates go, we could do worse than Harris."&#x2015;<b><i><i>New York Times Book Review</i></i></b><br><br>"Malcolm Harris's thesis is the kind of brilliantly simple idea that instantly clarifies an entire area of culture: Millennials are the way they are-anxious, harried, and 'narcissistically' self-focused, though hardly lazy or entitled-because the neoliberal economy has made them so. When we raise children in a world that reduces people to 'human capital', then bids down the price of that resource, what else should we expect? <i>Kids These Days</i> is deft, witty, unillusioned, and brutally frank.

In fewer than three hundred pages, he surveys the myriad hot takes on millennials-they're lazy, they're entitled, they're narcissists who buy avocado toast instead of homes, slacking on Snapchat at their unpaid internships-and asks, 'Why?'"&#x2015;<b><i><i>Bookforum</i></i></b><br><br>"Malcolm Harris restores a good deal of precision to the business of defining the millennial and generational discourse in general. Adhering to a Marxian and behaviorist account of society, Harris argues that you cannot understand millennials - those born between 1980 and 2000, which include him, and me for that matter - without examining the political, economic and social institutions that nurtured them...

It is the thesis of this major work that the American, French, and Polish revolutions, and the movements for political change in Britain, Ireland, Holland, Belgium, Switzerland, Sweden, and other countries, although each distinctive in its way, were all manifestations of recognizably similar political ideas, needs, and conflicts.</p><p>Volume 1 of this distinguished two-volume work, "The Challenge," received critical accolades throughout the world. It was the winner of the Bancroft Prize in 1960 and was called "one of the classic works of American historical scholarship" (<i>Key Reporter</i>) and a book which "will enlarge and clarify our understanding of modern Western history. It will re-emphasize the strength and vitality of the roots that supported the growth of democracy in the Old and New Worlds" (<i>New York Times</i>). "Occasionally a historical work appears which, by synthesis of much previous specialized work and by intelligent reflection upon the whole, makes events of the past click into a new pattern and assume fresh meaning. Professor Palmer's book is such a work" (<i>American Historical Review</i>).</p><p>"The Challenge" took the story to the eve of the French Revolutionary wars; Volume 2, "The Struggle" continues the account to 1800.</p></p><p><b>R. R. Palmer</b> (1909-2002), who taught at Princeton University from 1936 to 1963, the last eleven years as Dodge professor of history, was a past president of the American Historical Association. His other books include <i>A History of the Modern World</i> (later editions with Joel Colton) and <i>Twelve Who Ruled</i>. The first volume of <i>The Age of the Democratic Revolution</i> won the Bancroft Prize in 1960."With the publication of this second volume of <i>The Age of the Democratic Revolution</i>, R. R. Palmer concludes his patient and magisterial reassessment of the revolutionary ferment that stirred Europe and America between 1760 and 1800. . . . While Volume I covered thirty-two years, Volume II covers only eight, and the detail is correspondingly enriched. The stage remains the same, a vast stage extending from Scotland to Sicily and from Moscow to the Mississippi. Manipulating the spotlight of attention with skill and precision, Palmer shifts the focus from country to country, clarifying the particular conditions and specific developments in each. Despite the frequent changes of scene the drama is saved from incoherence by its dominant theme, a theme that emerges more strongly with each chapter as the evidence supporting it becomes more cumulative and convincing."<b>---Geoffrey Bruun, <i>Journal of Modern History</i></b><br><br>". . . This is the most important book on the Europe of the French Revolution published in English for more than a generation. It marks the turn of the tide, demonstrating as it does the hollowness of the current conservative interpretation of the Revolution and it will discredit for the future all sloppy generalizations about Jacobins, demagogues, and revolutionary mobs. . . . [Professor Palmer's] knowledge of printed sources is exceptionally thorough, ancient as well as modern, and his judgment of what is good and reliable seems unerring."<b>---J. H. Plumb, <i>New York Review of Books</i></b><br><br>". . .

One of the few people to talk frankly and sensitively about queerness and religion, celebrated Indian mythologist Devdutt Pattanaik explains that queerness isn&#x2019;t only modern, Western, or sexual. Rather, by looking at the vast written and oral traditions of Hinduism, he finds many overlooked tales with queerness at their center, some over two thousand years old. There&#x2019;s Shikhandi, who became a man to satisfy her wife; Mahadeva, who became a woman to deliver her devotee&#x2019;s child; Chudala, who became a man to enlighten her husband; Samavan, who became the wife of his male friend&#x2015;and many, many more.<br> In <i>Shikhandi, and Other Tales They Don&#x2019;t Tell You</i>, Pattanaik recounts these stories and explores the importance of mythologies in understanding the modern Indian mindset. Playful, touching, and sometimes disturbing, when <i>Shikhandi</i>&#x2019;s stories are compared with their Mesopotamian, Greek, Chinese, and Biblical counterparts, they reveal the unique Indian way of making sense of queerness.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Pattanaik is a master storyteller&#x201d; &#x2015;Bibek Debroy, translator of <i>The Bhagavad Gita</i></p><p><b>Devdutt Pattanaik</b> is a best-selling Indian author, speaker, and mythologist.

This book shows that children can and do engage in generalizing about numbers and operations as their mathematical experiences expand. The authors identify and examine five big ideas and associated essential understandings for developing algebraic thinking in grades 3 5. The big ideas relate to the fundamental properties of number and operations, the use of the equals sign to represent equivalence, variables as efficient tools for representing mathematical ideas, quantitative reasoning as a way to understand mathematical relationships, and functional thinking to generalize relationships between covarying quantities. The book examines challenges in teaching, learning, and assessment and is interspersed with questions for teachers reflection.</p><p></p><h2>Principles of Microeconomics</h2><p>PRINCIPLES OF MICROECONOMICS continues to be the most popular and widely used text in economics classrooms today.

He lives in Chicago with his wife and son.PreSchool-Grade 2-- Otter finds a big old soup pot in his new home and invites 26 friends to a potluck house-warming party, asking each to bring a food that's soup-worthy. From Armadillo with his asparagus, to Zebra with his zucchini (" "zactly what zee zoup needz!' "), they all contribute to a hearty meal and a lush, lively alphabet book. Gustafson's beautiful paintings are dark and soft, and his striking use of light adds drama and depth: Koala's kumquats and krill are breathtaking as she shows them off against her cobalt blue kerchief. And the fungi in Mole's mushroom mine seem magical, illuminated by the beam from mole's miner hat. The artist creates interest via textures, colors, and a nod to the eccentric and exotic here and there, without undue clutter. Humor, which touches most of the illustrations, is especially rich in the case of Reptile (roasting his rutabagas ranch-style) and Frog (grinning as she flips her flapjack right off the page). Effective layouts back up gorgeous design to produce striking, cohesive images with the ability to unite, for readers, the letter and the word it begins. The large, handsome illustrations make the book a prime candidate for story time use.

If your finances had a 10 percent chance of suffering a severe loss, you'd reevaluate your assets. So if we know the world is warming and there's a 10 percent chance this might eventually lead to a catastrophe beyond anything we could imagine, why aren't we doing more about climate change right now? We insure our lives against an uncertain future&#x2015;why not our planet?</p><p>In <i>Climate Shock</i>, Gernot Wagner and Martin Weitzman explore in lively, clear terms the likely repercussions of a hotter planet, drawing on and expanding from work previously unavailable to general audiences. They show that the longer we wait to act, the more likely an extreme event will happen. A city might go underwater. A rogue nation might shoot particles into the Earth's atmosphere, geoengineering cooler temperatures. Zeroing in on the unknown extreme risks that may yet dwarf all else, the authors look at how economic forces that make sensible climate policies difficult to enact, make radical would-be fixes like geoengineering all the more probable. What we know about climate change is alarming enough. What we don't know about the extreme risks could be far more dangerous. Wagner and Weitzman help readers understand that we need to think about climate change in the same way that we think about insurance&#x2015;as a risk management problem, only here on a global scale.</p><p>With a new preface addressing recent developments Wagner and Weitzman demonstrate that climate change can and should be dealt with&#x2015;and what could happen if we don't do so&#x2015;tackling the defining environmental and public policy issue of our time.</p></p><p><p>"A remarkable book on climate change, <i>Climate Shock</i> is deeply insightful, challenging, eye-opening, thought-provoking, and sheer fun to read.

"Pride and Prejudice seems as vital today as ever," writes Anna Quindlen in her introduction to this Modern Library edition. "It is a pure joy to read." Eudora Welty agrees: "The gaiety is unextinguished, the irony has kept its bite, the reasoning is still sweet, the sparkle undiminished. [It is] irresistible and as nearly flawless as any fiction could be." <br><br>This volume is the companion to the BBC television series, a lavish production aired on the Arts and Entertainment Network.<br><br>The Modern Library has played a significant role in American cultural life for the better part of a century. The series was founded in 1917 by the publishers Boni and Liveright and eight years later acquired by Bennett Cerf and Donald Klopfer. It provided the foun-dation for their next publishing venture, Random House. The Modern Library has been a staple of the American book trade, providing readers with affordable hard-bound editions of important works of liter-ature and thought. For the Modern Library's seventy-fifth anniversary, Random House redesigned the series, restoring as its emblem the running torchbearer created by Lucian Bernhard in 1925 and refurbishing jackets, bindings, and type, as well as inau-gurating a new program of selecting titles. The Modern Library continues to provide the world's best books, at the best prices.</p><p><i>"It is a truth universally acknowledged, that a single man in possession of a good fortune, must be in want of a wife."</i> <p> Next to the exhortation at the beginning of <i>Moby-Dick</i>, "Call me Ishmael," the first sentence of Jane Austen's <i>Pride and Prejudice</i> must be among the most quoted in literature. And certainly what Melville did for whaling Austen does for marriage--tracing the intricacies (not to mention the economics) of 19th-century British mating rituals with a sure hand and an unblinking eye. As usual, Austen trains her sights on a country village and a few families--in this case, the Bennets, the Philips, and the Lucases. Into their midst comes Mr. Bingley, a single man of good fortune, and his friend, Mr. Darcy, who is even richer. Mrs. Bennet, who married above her station, sees their arrival as an opportunity to marry off at least one of her five daughters. Bingley is complaisant and easily charmed by the eldest Bennet girl, Jane; Darcy, however, is harder to please. Put off by Mrs. Bennet's vulgarity and the untoward behavior of the three younger daughters, he is unable to see the true worth of the older girls, Jane and Elizabeth. His excessive pride offends Lizzy, who is more than willing to believe the worst that other people have to say of him; when George Wickham, a soldier stationed in the village, does indeed have a discreditable tale to tell, his words fall on fertile ground. </p> <p> Having set up the central misunderstanding of the novel, Austen then brings in her cast of fascinating secondary characters: Mr. Collins, the sycophantic clergyman who aspires to Lizzy's hand but settles for her best friend, Charlotte, instead; Lady Catherine de Bourgh, Mr. Darcy's insufferably snobbish aunt; and the Gardiners, Jane and Elizabeth's low-born but noble-hearted aunt and uncle. Some of Austen's best comedy comes from mixing and matching these representatives of different classes and economic strata, demonstrating the hypocrisy at the heart of so many social interactions. And though the novel is rife with romantic misunderstandings, rejected proposals, disastrous elopements, and a requisite happy ending for those who deserve one, Austen never gets so carried away with the romance that she loses sight of the hard economic realities of 19th-century matrimonial maneuvering. Good marriages for penniless girls such as the Bennets are hard to come by, and even Lizzy, who comes to sincerely value Mr. Darcy, remarks when asked when she first began to love him: "It has been coming on so gradually, that I hardly know when it began. But I believe I must date it from my first seeing his beautiful grounds at Pemberley." She may be joking, but there's more than a little truth to her sentiment, as well. Jane Austen considered Elizabeth Bennet "as delightful a creature as ever appeared in print". Readers of <i>Pride and Prejudice</i> would be hard-pressed to disagree. <i>--Alix Wilber</i></p>First published in 1813, and Austen&#39;s most popular novel in her own lifetime, Pride and Prejudice has since been widely recognised as one of the finest novels in the English language. This edition, first published in 2006, is an indispensable resource for all scholars and readers of Austen.</p><h2>World-Class Warehousing and Material Handling</h2><p><p><b>Timeless Insights for Planning and Managing 21st-Century Warehouse Operations</b></p> <p>Despite today's just-in-time production mentality, with its efforts to eliminate warehouses and their inventory carrying costs, effective warehousing continues to play a critical bottom-line role for companies worldwide. <i>World-Class Warehousing and Material Handling </i>covers today's state-of-the-art tools, metrics, and methodologies for dramatically increasing the effectiveness, accuracy, and overall productivity of warehousing operations.</p> <p>Written by one of today's recognized logistics thought leaders, this comprehensive resource provides authoritative answers on such topics as: </p> <ul> <li>The seven principles of world-class warehousing</li> <li>Warehouse activity profiling</li> <li>Warehouse performance measures</li> <li>Warehouse automation and computerization</li> <li>Receiving and put away</li> <li>Storage and retrieval operations</li> <li>Picking and packing</li> <li>Humanizing warehouse operations</li> </ul> <p><i>World-Class Warehousing and Material Handling </i>describes the processes and systems required for meeting the changing demands of warehousing.

S. Forester. The often dense technical detail of these works is explained here for the general reader through text and illustrations that bring the period vividly to life. Through his discussions of single-ship actions, fleet operations, famous commanders, and the day-to-day routines of the men who worked the ships, Bernard Ireland investigates how the navy of King George III came to dominate the high seas, ushering in a century of British maritime supremacy. Acclaimed naval artist Tony Gibbons illustrates every type of sailing warship from ships of the line, frigates, and sloops to privateers' schooners, bomb ketches, and xebecs. Color illustrations throughout</p><p>The life of an ordinary sailor in the 18th and 19th centuries was no easy matter, as Patrick O'Brian's Aubrey/Maturin and C. S. Forester's Hornblower novels depict so well. Quite apart from the dangers from howling storms and whistling cannonballs, seamen were paid and fed poorly and subject to all manner of inhumane discipline. Given all that, Bernard Ireland wonders, how could it have been that sailors under English--and French, Spanish, and American--flags could have performed with such heroic distinction at sea?<p> His answer arrives at many points throughout his encyclopedic study of the "age when the man counted, and not the technology." Profiling such figures as John Paul Jones and Lord Nelson, as well as many of those ordinary sailors, and such little-known events as the siege of Acre and the War of Jenkins's Ear, Ireland provides a highly readable survey of the great age of sail-driven combat, when mighty navies traversed the world to secure empires for the great powers of two continents. He turns up dozens of illuminating oddments from the historical record, such as the Duke of Wellington's refusal to command England's forces during the War of 1812 and Napoleon Bonaparte's failure to coordinate his navy with his land forces, which contributed to his ultimate defeat. (A similar failure, Ireland writes, led to England's defeat in the American Revolution.)</p><p> Along the way, too, Ireland provides terminology and copious illustrations that will be useful to readers of the aforementioned O'Brian and Forester novels, for which this book makes a fine companion volume. <i>--Gregory McNamee</i></p>Bernard Ireland, a naval engineer, is the author of many books, including Jane&#39;s War at Sea and Jane&#39;s Naval History of World War II.</p><h2>Borderwall as Architecture: A Manifesto for the U.S.-Mexico Boundary (Ahmanson-Murphy Fine Arts Imprint)</h2><p><b>&#x201c;A protest against the wall and a forecast about its future.&#x201d;&#x2014;Allison Arieff,&nbsp;<i>The New York Times</i></b><br><br> "Rael&#x2019;s courageous mixture of subversion and compromise is not going to hide the affront that the border represents to those who live south of it."&#x2014;<i>London Review of Books</i><br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;<i>Borderwall as Architecture</i> explores how architects can undermine the wall not just structurally, but conceptually. Today, the wall symbolizes xenophobia and fear. Designs that promote social, economic, and ecological development on both sides of the border could rewrite that narrative. In the past, groups have gathered on both sides of the wall to hold yoga meetups and stage horse races. Rael draws inspiration from these and other examples to highlight opportunities for subversion and change.&#x201d;&#x2014;<i>Wired</i><br> &nbsp;<br> "Part historical account, part theoretical appraisal, and part design manifesto, <i>Borderwall as Architecture</i> is reminiscent of Rem Koolhaas&#x2019; <i>Delirious New York</i> in its sweeping assessment of both the sociocultural peculiarities and outlandish possibilities represented by a prominent structural element."&#x2014;<i>Architect Magazine</i><br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;<i>Borderwall As Architecture</i> goes into keen scholarly detail on the walls at the US-Mexico border...Rael offers many such concepts in the book, which often have a whimsy about them that reminds me of Italo Calvino&#x2019;s <i>Invisible Cities</i>.&#x201d;<br> &#x2014;<i>New Scientist</i><br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;[Rael&#x2019;s] imagination is audacious, and he smartly frames his &#x201c;grand tour&#x201d; of the border as a procession of vignettes that shift easily between history, architectural what-ifs and what you might call postcards from the front.&#x201d;&#x2014; <i>San Francisco Chronicle</i><br> &nbsp;<br> "...in raising questions that not many others are asking about the relationship between two countries that share 2,000 miles of border, his book serves an important purpose."&#x2014;<i>The Daily Beast</i><br><br><i>Borderwall as Architecture</i>&nbsp;is an artistic and intellectual hand grenade of a book, and a timely re-examination of what the physical barrier that divides the United States of America from the United Mexican States is and could be. It is both a protest against the wall and a projection about its future. Through a series of propositions suggesting that the nearly seven hundred miles of wall is an opportunity for economic and social development along the border that encourages its conceptual and physical dismantling, the book takes readers on a journey along a wall that cuts through a &#x201c;third nation&#x201d;&#x2014;the Divided States of America. On the way the transformative effects of the wall on people, animals, and the natural and built landscape are exposed and interrogated through the story of people who, on both sides of the border, transform the wall, challenging its existence in remarkably creative ways. Coupled with these real-life accounts are counterproposals for the wall, created by Rael&#x2019;s studio, that reimagine, hyperbolize, or question the wall and its construction, cost, performance, and meaning. Rael proposes that despite the intended use of the wall, which is to keep people out and away, the wall is instead an attractor, engaging both sides in a common dialogue. Included is a collection of reflections on the wall and its consequences by leading experts Michael Dear, Norma Iglesias-Prieto, Marcello Di Cintio, and Teddy Cruz.</p><p>&#x201c;A fascinating book, astonishing and magical: a realm where the absurdity of a wall is&nbsp;transformed from obstructive&nbsp;and negative to an affirmation of shared humanity.&#x201d;&#x2014;Judith Torrea, journalist and&nbsp;author based in Ciudad Ju�rez, M�xico<br> &nbsp;<br> "Timely and provocative,&nbsp;<i>Borderwall as Architecture</i>&nbsp;is an eloquent appeal to reconsider the principles and prejudices of nationalism within the context of the built environment."&#x2014;Jonathon Keats, experimental philosopher and author of&nbsp;<i>You Belong to the Universe: Buckminster Fuller and the Future</i><br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;No longer sovereign limits of exchange, borders are at once indexes of national as well as individual identities. <i>Borderwall as Architecture</i> interrogates how the the securitization of the United States' southernmost limits radically define new landscapes of transaction that can also be visualized as a tool of violence. Among Ronald Rael's elegant ironies seen across anticipatory yet moving drawings and projects, the Mexico-US border fence/wall registers a figurative logic in which seemingly banal aspects of porosity, transparency, and locality also confront architecture's and our own roles in two nations' un-becoming.&#x201d;&#x2014;Sean Anderson, Curator, Architecture and Design, MOMA<b>Ronald Rael</b> is Associate Professor in the departments of Architecture and Art Practice at the University of California, Berkeley.

He is shipwrecked, abandoned, marooned, and mutinied against, and each time lands in a strange and curious place. First he discovers the kingdom of the six-inch-tall Lilliputians, then the country of the giant Brobdingnagians, then the island of the academic Laputans, which floats in the sky, and finally the noble realm of the horselike Houyhnhnms. Who knew there were so many unusual creatures under the sun?</p><p>Jonathan Swift was born in Dublin, Ireland, in 1667, where he lived for much of his life. He was well known for writing satires and political pamphlets. In 1726, Swift published <i>Gulliver's Travels</i> anonymously and it was an immediate hit, reprinting three times that year. Although <i>Gulliver's Travels</i> was written as a satire of human pride, not as a children's book, it has long been considered a classic for young readers. Jonathan Swift died on October 19, 1745.<b><br></b></p><h2>The Mabinogion: A Facsimile Reproduction of the Complete 1877 Edition</h2><p>A major illustrated edition of the classic fantasy with over 50 full-colour paintings by the celebrated artist of The Lord of the Rings.Before The Lord of the Rings there was THE MABINOGION. Widely recognized as the finest arc of Celtic mythology, the eleven stories were preserved in two Welsh collections, The White Book of Rhydderch (c.1300-1325) and The Red Book of Hergest (1375-1425), though the stories themselves hail from an oral tradition dating back to the tenth century. At its core are tales of heroes and men, birth and death, gods and beasts, penance and vindication, kinship and kingship, battles and quests.THE MABINOGION embraces much of ancient and early British culture, combining the numinous world of Celtic mythology, Arthurian legend and feudal Europe&#39;s Age of Chivalry. Indeed, scholars have identified that it was out of THE MABINOGION that the Arthurian legends were born.This new edition contains the definitive translation of the work by Lady Charlotte Guest, undoubtably the most accessible of those published, and includes the tale of Taliesin, which has been missing from the collected tales of the Mabinogion for over twenty years. It also contains 50 colour paintings by Alan Lee, many appearing here for the first time. Best known for his work on the illustrated editions of The Lord of the Rings and The Hobbit, it was always Alan Lee&#39;s ambition to illustrate THE MABINOGION, as it combines his main interests of folklore, legend and the supernatural. His style lends itself perfectly to the work and his interpretation will give enormous pleasure as the stories enter their third millennium.</p><p>Alan Lee was born in Middlesex in 1947. His illustrated books include Faeries (with Brian Froud), Castles and Merlin Dreams, and he has worked on such prestigious films as Erik the Viking (Terry Gilliam), Legend (Ridley Scott), and the acclaimed NBC miniseries Merlin. He is best known, however, for his work on the book and film versions of The Lord of the Rings and The Hobbit.Text: English (translation)<br> Original Language: Welsh</p><h2>An Introduction to the Indo-European Languages</h2><p><p>This comprehensive linguistic survey of the Indo-European groups synthesizes the vast amount of information contained in the spe�cialized handbooks of the individual stocks.</p><p>The text begins with an introduction to the concept of the Indo-European language family, the history of its discovery, and the techniques of analysis. The introduction also gives a structural sketch of Proto-Indo-European, the parent language from which the others are descended. Baldi then devotes a chapter to each of the 11 major branches of Indo-European (Italic, Celtic, Indo-Iranian, Greek, Armenian, Albanian, Baltic, Slavic, Germanic, Tocharian, and Anatolian).</p><p>Each chapter provides an outline of the external history of the branch, its people, di�alects, and other relevant history. This out�line is followed by a structural sketch of the most important language or languages of the branch (e.g., Old Irish for Celtic, Sanskrit and Avestan for Indo-Iranian, Latin and Osco-Umbrian for Italic). The sketch also contains the phonology, morphology, and syntax of each language. There is lastly a sample text of each language containing both interlinear and free translation. In those branches where there are special issues (e.g., the relation of Italic to Celtic and Baltic to Slavic, or the problem of archaism in Hittite), additional discussions of these issues are pro�vided. Baldi&#x2019;s final chapter gives a brief out�line of the &#x201c;minor&#x201d; Indo-European lan�guages such as Illyrian, Thracian, Raetic, and Phrygian. Adding further to the usefulness of the book are extensive bibliographies, an up-to-date map showing the geographical dis�tribution of the Indo-European languages throughout the world, and a detailed family tree diagram of the members of each sub�group within the Indo-European language family and their interrelationships.</p></p><p>Intended for use in general courses on Indo-European languages and linguistics, this comprehensive assessment of Indo-European groups fills the long-standing need for synthesizing the vast amount of information available in specialized handbooks of the individual stocks.<p><b>Philip Baldi</b> is Professor of Linguistics and Classics and Director of the Linguistics Pro�gram at Pennsylvania State University.

But it was a great power that was universally regarded as backward by comparison with Britain, Germany, and France. As Russia moved from under the weight of World War I, Western influences began to settle upon this vast empire, leading the way to the turbulent years of the Russian Revolution. <p>Now in a new edition, this provocative and eminently readable work looks at the many upheavals of this long and often devastating period as successive stages in a single process--the Russian Revolution. Focusing on the Russian Revolution in its widest sense, Fitzpatrick covers not only the events of 1917 and what preceded them, but the nature of the social transformation brought about by the Bolsheviks after they took power. Making use of a huge amount of previously secret information in Soviet archives and unpublished memoirs, this detailed chronology recounts each monumental event from the February and October Revolutions of 1917 and the Civil War of 1918-1920, through the New Economic Policy of 1921 and the 1929 First Five-Year Plan, to Stalin's "revolution from above" at the end of the 1920s and the Great Purge of the late 1930s. </p><p>Lucid and concise, this classic study makes comprehendible the complex events of the revolution.</p></p><p><br><em>About the Author</em><br> <strong>Sheila Fitzpatrick</strong> is Professor of History at the University of Chicago.<br><br>Review from previous edition "A lucid and indeed instantly classic explanation of the revolutionary spirit in its pre-1917 and Lenin-then-Stalin dominated stages."--Tribune<p><br>"A succinct, insightful, and highly original interpretation of the Russian Revolution as a process of social transformation lasting from 1917 to 1937...

From longer work hours to the election of Donald Trump, our current political crisis is above all about reproduction.&nbsp;Households are where we face our economic realities&nbsp;as social safety nets get cut and wages decline. Briggs brilliantly outlines how politicians&#x2019; racist accounts of reproduction&#x2014;stories of Black &#x201c;welfare queens&#x201d; and Latina &#x201c;breeding machines"&#x2014;were the leading wedge in the government and business disinvestment in families. With decreasing wages, rising McJobs, and no resources for family care, our households have grown ever more precarious over the past forty years in sharply race-and class-stratified ways. This crisis, argues Briggs, fuels all others&#x2014;from immigration to gay marriage, anti-feminism to the rise of the Tea Party.</p><p>&#x201c;This book is a tour de force that highlights the failures of neoliberalism for many American families. With intensity and verve, Laura Briggs reveals the crisscrossing binds that constrain women, particularly women of color, queer women, and poor women.

The question the students asked Weber to address in these lectures was simple and haunting. In a modern world characterized by the division of labor, constant economic expansion, and unrelenting change, was vocation, in intellectual work or politics, still possible? Responding to the students&#x2019; sense of urgency, Weber offered his clearest account of &#x201c;the disenchantment of the world,&#x201d; as well as a seminal discussion of the place of values in the university classroom and academic research. Similarly, in his politics lecture he gave students what is undoubtedly his pithiest version of his account of the nature of political authority. Weber&#x2019;s attempts to rethink vocation remain as relevant and as stirring as ever.</p><p><b>Max Weber</b> (1864&#x2013;1920) was a sociologist, philosopher, jurist, and political economist.

He seemed marked for a successful and conventional academic career. Then the philosophy of Schopenhauer and the music of Wagner transformed his ambitions. The genius of such thinkers and makers&#x2014;the kind of genius that had emerged in ancient Greece&#x2014;this alone was the touchstone for true understanding. But how was education to serve genius, especially in a modern society marked more and more by an unholy alliance between academic specialization, mass-market journalism, and the militarized state? Something more than sturdy scholarship was called for. A new way of teaching and questioning, a new philosophy . . .<br><br>What that new way might be was the question Nietzsche broached in five vivid, popular public lectures in Basel in 1872.&nbsp;<i>Anti-Education</i>&nbsp;presents a provocative and timely reckoning with what remains one of the central challenges of the modern world.&nbsp;<br><br></p></p><p><b>Friedrich Nietzsche</b> (1844&#x2013;1900) was born in R�cken bei L�tzen, a farming town outside of Leipzig, to a long line of Lutheran ministers. After his father&#x2019;s early death from a brain disease, the family relocated to Naumburg an der Saale. Nietzsche attended the Schulpforta boarding school, where he became enamored with the music of Richard Wagner and the writings of the German Romantics, before going on to study at the Universities of Bonn and Leipzig. As a university student, Nietzsche gained a reputation as a classical philologist and discovered Arthur Schopenhauer&#x2019;s <i>The World as Will and Representation</i>, the &#x201c;cadaverous perfume&#x201d; of which would hang over him throughout his career. After a period of compulsory military service, Nietzsche was appointed to the faculty of the University of Basel at the age of twenty-four. He published his first book, <i>The Birth of Tragedy</i>, in 1872, but his deteriorating health soon forced him to retire from academia. In the itinerant period that followed, Nietzsche completed his most influential works, including <i>Thus Spoke Zarathustra</i> (1883&#x2013;85), <i>Beyond Good and Evil</i> (1886), and <i>The Antichrist </i>(1888). He suffered a mental breakdown in Turin on January 3, 1889&#x2014;purportedly at the sight of a horse being beaten by a coachman. Before collapsing, Nietzsche is said to have thrown his arms around the horse&#x2019;s neck to shield it from the whip. Three days later, he wrote in a letter to his mentor Jacob Burckhardt that he would rather be &#x201c;a Basel Professor than God.&#x201d; He was subsequently hospitalized, and lived the rest of his life an invalid&nbsp; in the care of his mother and sister.&nbsp;<br><br><b>Damion Searls</b> has translated many classic twentieth-century writers, including Marcel Proust, Rainer Maria Rilke, Elfriede Jelinek, Christa Wolf, Hans Keilson, and Hermann Hesse.

He was a philosopher-poet concerned not simply with describing and explaining the world as he found it, but with identifying and employing the electrifying arts that make the world appear uncanny and ineffably deep.&#x201d;&nbsp;&#x2014;Tamsin Shaw<br><br> &#x201c;Nietzsche wants to hear idols break. Dismay, exasperation, anger, outrage, disgust, humiliation disappointment: they fuel his philosophy, and it is little without them. Exhilaration, joy, exuberance, excess: they feed it too.&#x201d;&nbsp;&#x2014;William H. Gass<br><br>&#x201c;Paul Reitter and Chad Wellmon&#x2019;s introduction and notes helpfully contextualize Nietzsche&#x2019;s barbs, though much of what Nietzsche has to say transcends the milieu in which it was written, and many of his criticisms will resound with readers today...this translation, with its useful notes and introduction, certainly provokes and surprises.&#x201d; &#x2014;Jon Morris,&nbsp;<i>Popmatters</i><br><br>"Whether we acknowledge it or not, we continue to live within the intellectual shadow cast by Nietzsche. Postmodernism, deconstructionism, cultural relativism, the "free spirit" scorning bourgeois morality, even New Age festivals like Burning Man can all ultimately be traced to him." --Francis Fukuyama, <i>The New York Times Book Review</i><br><br>"Prof. Nietzsche was one of the most prominent of modern German philosophers, and he is considered the apostle of extreme modern rationalism and one of the founders of the socialistic school, whose ideas have had such a profound influence on the growth of political and social life throughout the civilized world...his doctrines however, were inspired by lofty aspirations, while the brilliancy of his thought and diction and the epigrammatic force of his writings commanded even the admiration of his most pronounced enemies, of which he had many." --<i>The New York Times&nbsp;</i><br><br>"Having challenged the foundations of all external authority, Nietzsche demonstrated that the intellect, once it frees itself of all binding illusions philosophical, religious, and cultural, knows no piety, no party, and no platform." --Jennifer Ratner-Rosenhagen, <i>The Making of the American Nietzsche&nbsp;</i></p><h2>Never Cry Wolf</h2><p>Hordes of bloodthirsty wolves are slaughtering the arctic caribou, and the government's Wildlife Service assigns naturalist Farely Mowat to investigate. Mowat is dropped alone onto the frozen tundra, where he begins his mission to live among the howling wolf packs and study their waves. Contact with his quarry comes quickly, and Mowat discovers not a den of marauding killers but a courageous family of skillful providers and devoted protectors of their young. As Mowat comes closer to the wolf world, he comes to fear with them on onslaught of bounty hunters and government exterminators out to erase the noble wolf community from the Arctic. <i>Never Cry Wolf</i> is one of the brilliant narratives on the myth and magical world of wild wolves and man's true place among the creatures of nature. "We have doomed the wolf not for what it is, but for what we deliberately and mistakenly perceive it to be -- the mythological epitome of a savage, ruthless killer -- which is, in reality, no more than the reflected image of ourself." -- from the new preface to <i>Never Cry Wolf</i>.</p><p><b>Farley Mowat</b> was born in Belleville, Ontario, in 1921, and grew up in Belleville, Trenton, Windsor, Saskatoon, Toronto, and Richmond Hill. He served in World War II from 1940 until 1945, entering the army as a private and emerging with the rank of captain. He began writing for his living in 1949 after spending two years in the Arctic. Since 1949 he has lived in or visited almost every part of Canada and many other lands, including the distant regions of Siberia. He remains an inveterate traveller with a passion for remote places and peoples.

His short stories and articles have appeared in <i>The Saturday Evening Post</i>, <i>Maclean&#x2019;s</i>, <i>Atlantic Monthly</i> and other magazines.<b>Chapter 1</b><br><b>The Lupine Project<br></b><br>It is a long way in time and space from the bathroom of my Grandmother Mowat&#x2019;s house in Oakville, Ontario, to the bottom of a wolf den in the Barren Lands of central Keewatin, and I have no intention of retracing the entire road which lies between. Nevertheless, there must be a beginning to any tale; and the story of my sojourn amongst the wolves begins properly in Granny&#x2019;s bathroom.<br><br>When I was five years old I had still not given any indication &#x2013; as most gifted children do well before that age &#x2013; of where my future lay. Perhaps because they were disappointed by my failure to declare myself, my parents took me to Oakville and abandoned me to the care of my grandparents while they went off on a holiday.<br><br>The Oakville house &#x2013; &#x201c;Greenhedges&#x201d; it was called &#x2013; was a singularly genteel establishment, and I did not feel at home there. My cousin, who was resident in Greenhedges and was some years older than myself, had already found his m�tier, which lay in the military field, and had amassed a formidable army of lead soldiers with which he was single-mindedly preparing himself to become a second Wellington. My loutish inability to play Napoleon exasperated him so much that he refused to have anything to do with me except under the most formal circumstances.<br><br>Grandmother, an aristocratic lady of Welsh descent who had never forgiven her husband for having been a retail hardware merchant, tolerated me but terrified me too. She terrified most people, including Grandfather, who had long since sought surcease in assumed deafness. He used to while away the days as calm and unruffled as Buddha, ensconced in a great leather chair and apparently oblivious to the storms which swirled through the corridors of Greenhedges. And yet I know for a fact that he could hear the word &#x201c;whiskey&#x201d; if it was whispered in a room three stories removed from where he sat.<br><br>Because there were no soulmates for me at Greenhedges, I took to roaming about by myself, resolutely eschewing the expenditure of energy on anything even remotely useful; and thereby, if anyone had had the sense to see it, giving a perfectly clear indication of the pattern of my future.<br><br>One hot summer day I was meandering aimlessly beside a little local creek when I came upon a stagnant pool. In the bottom, and only just covered with green scum, three catfish lay gasping out their lives. They interested me. I dragged them up on the bank with a stick and waited expectantly for them to die; but this they refused to do. Just when I was convinced that they were quite dead, they would open their broad ugly jaws and give another gasp. I was so impressed by their stubborn refusal to accept their fate that I found a tin can, put them in it along with some scum, and took them home.<br><br>I had begun to like them, in an abstract sort of way, and wished to know them better. But the problem of where to keep them while our acquaintanceship ripened was a major one. There were no washtubs in Greenhedges. There <i>was</i> a bathtub, but the stopper did not fit and consequently it would not hold water for more than a few minutes. By bedtime I had still not resolved the problem and, since I felt that even these doughty fish could hardly survive an entire night in the tin can, I was driven to the admittedly desperate expedient of finding temporary lodgings for them in the bowl of Granny&#x2019;s old-fashioned toilet.<br><br>I was too young at the time to appreciate the special problems which old age brings in its train. It was one of these problems which was directly responsible for the dramatic and unexpected encounter which took place between my grandmother and the catfish during the small hours of the ensuing night.<br><br>It was a traumatic experience for Granny, and for me, and probably for the catfish too. Throughout the rest of her life Granny refused to eat fish of any kind, and always carried a high-powered flashlight with her during her nocturnal peregrinations. I cannot be as certain about the effect on the catfish, for my unfeeling cousin &#x2013; once the hooferaw had died down a little &#x2013; callously flushed the toilet. As for myself, the effect was to engender in me a lasting affinity for the lesser beasts of the animal kingdom. In a word, the affair of the catfish marked the beginning of my career, first as a naturalist, and later as a biologist. I had started on my way to the wolf den.<br><br>My infatuation with the study of animate nature grew rapidly into a full-fledged love affair. I found that even the human beings with whom the study brought me into contact could be fascinating too. My first mentor was a middle-aged Scotsman who gained his livelihood delivering ice, but who was in fact an ardent amateur mammalogist. At a tender age he had developed mange, or leprosy, or some other such infantile disease, and had lost all his hair, never to recover it &#x2013; a tragedy which may have had a bearing on the fact that, when I knew him, he had already devoted fifteen years of his life to a study of the relationship between summer molt and incipient narcissism in pocket gophers. This man had become so intimate with gophers that he could charm them with sibilant whistles until they would emerge from their underground retreats and passively allow him to examine the hair on their backs.<br>Nor were the professional biologists with whom I later came into contact one whit less interesting. When I was eighteen I spent a summer doing field work in the company of another mammalogist, seventy years of age, who was replete with degrees and whose towering stature in the world of science had been earned largely by an exhaustive study of uterine scars in shrews. This man, a revered professor at a large American university, knew more about the uteri of shrews than any other man has ever known. Furthermore he could talk about his subject with real enthusiasm. Death will find me long before I tire of contemplating an evening spent in his company during which he enthralled a mixed audience consisting of a fur trader, a Cree Indian matron, and an Anglican missionary, with an hour-long monologue on sexual aberrations in female pygmy shrews. (The trader misconstrued the tenor of the discourse; but the missionary, inured by years of humorless dissertations, soon put him right.)<br>My early years as a naturalist were free and fascinating, but as I entered manhood and found that my avocation must now become my vocation, the walls began to close in. The happy days of the universal scholar who was able to take a keen interest in all phases of natural history were at an end, and I was forced to recognize the unpalatable necessity of specializing, if I was to succeed as a professional biologist. Nevertheless, as I began my academic training at the university, I found it difficult to choose the narrow path.<br><br>For a time I debated whether or not to follow the lead of a friend of mine who was specializing in scatology &#x2013; the study of the excretory droppings of animals &#x2013; and who later became a high-ranking scatologist with the United States Biological Survey. But although I found the subject mildly interesting, it failed to rouse my enthusiasm to the pitch where I could wish to make it my lifework. Besides, the field was overcrowded.<br><br>My personal predelictions lay towards studies of living animals in their own habitat. Being a literal fellow, I took the word <i>biology &#x2013; </i>which means the study of life &#x2013; at its face value. I was sorely puzzled by the paradox that many of my contemporaries tended to shy as far away from living things as they could get, and chose to restrict themselves instead to the aseptic atmosphere of laboratories where they used dead &#x2013; often very dead &#x2013; animal material as their subject matter. In fact, during my time at the university it was becoming unfashionable to have <i>anything</i> to do with animals, even dead ones. The new biologists were concentrating on statistical and analytical research, whereby the raw material of life became no more than fodder for the nourishment of calculating machines.<br><br>My inability to adjust to the new trends had an adverse effect upon my professional expectations. While my fellow students were already establishing themselves in various esoteric specialties, most of which they invented for themselves on the theory that if you are the <i>only</i> specialist in a given field you need fear no competition, I was still unable to deflect my interests from the general to the particular. As graduation approached I found that the majority of my contemporaries were assured of excellent research jobs while I seemed to have nothing particular to offer in the biological marketplace. It was, therefore, inevitable that I should end up working for the Government.<br><br>The die was cast one winter&#x2019;s day when I received a summons from the Dominion Wildlife Service informing me that I had been hired at the munificent salary of one hundred and twenty dollars a month, and that I &#x201c;would&#x201d; report to Ottawa at once.<br><br>I obeyed this peremptory order with hardly more than a twitch of subdued rebelliousness, for if I had learned anything during my years at the university it was that the scientific hierarchy requires a high standard of obedience, if not subservience, from its acolytes.<br><br>Two days later I arrived in the windswept, gray-souled capital of Canada and found my way into the dingy labyrinth which housed the Wildlife Service. Here I presented myself to the Chief Mammalogist, whom I had known as a school chum in more carefree days. But alas, he had now metamorphosed into a full-blown scientist, and was so shrouded in professional dignity that it was all I could do to refrain from making him a profound obeisance.<br><br>Through the next several days I was subjected to something called &#x201c;orientation&#x201d; &#x2013; a process which, so far as I could see, was designed to reduce me to a malleable state of hopeless depression. At any rate, the legions of Dantesque bureaucrats whom I visited in their gloomy, Formalin-smelling dens, where they spent interminable hours compiling dreary data or originating meaningless memos, did nothing to rouse in me much devotion to my new employment. The only thing I actually <i>learned</i> during this period was that, by comparison with the bureaucratic hierarchy in Ottawa, the scientific hierarchy was a brotherhood of anarchy.<br><br>This was driven home one memorable day when, having at last been certified as fit for inspection, I was paraded into the office of the Deputy Minister, where I so far forgot myself as to address him as &#x201c;Mister.&#x201d; My escort of the moment, all white-faced and trembling, immediately rushed me out of the Presence and took me by devious ways to the men&#x2019;s washroom. Having first knelt down and peered under the doors of all the cubicles to make absolutely certain we were alone and could not be overheard, he explained in an agonized whisper that I must never, on pain of banishment, address the Deputy as anything but &#x201c;Chief,&#x201d; or, barring that, by his Boer War title of &#x201c;Colonel.&#x201d;<br><br>Military titles were <i>de rigeur</i>. All memos were signed Captain-this or Lieutenant-that if they originated from the lower echelons; or Colonel-this and Brigadier-that if they came down from on high. Those members of the staff who had not had the opportunity to acquire even quasi-military status were reduced to the expedient of inventing suitable ranks &#x2013; field ranks if they were senior men, and subaltern ranks for the juniors. Not everyone took this matter with due solemnity, and I met one new employee in the fishery section who distinguished himself briefly by sending a memo up to the Chief signed &#x201c;J. Smith, Acting Lance-Corporal.&#x201d; A week later this foolhardy youth was on his way to the northernmost tip of Ellesmere Island, there to spend his exile living in an igloo while studying the life history of the nine-spined stickleback.<br>Levity was not looked upon with favor anywhere in those austere offices, as I discovered for myself while attending a conference concerning my first assignment.<br><br>A tentative list of the material requirements for this assignment lay on the conference table, surrounded by many grave countenances. It was a formidable document, made out in quintuplicate &#x2013; as was the official rule &#x2013; and imposingly headed:<br><br>DESIDERATA FOR THE LUPINE PROJECT<br><br>Having already been unnerved by the gravity of the gathering, I lost my head completely when the assembly began to consider the twelfth item listed in this horrendous document:<br><br><i>Paper, toilet, Government standard: 12 rolls</i>.<br>An austere suggestion by the representative of the Finance Department that, in the interest of economy, the quantity of this item might be reduced, providing the field party (which was me) exercised all due restraint, sent me into an hysterical spasm of giggling. I mastered myself almost instantly, but it was too late. The two most senior men, both &#x201c;majors,&#x201d; rose to their feet, bowed coldly, and left the room without a word.<br><br>The Ottawa ordeal drew toward its end; but the climax was still to come. One early spring morning I was called to the office of the senior officer who was my direct chief, for a final interview before departing &#x201c;into the field.&#x201d;<br><br>My chief sat behind a massive desk whose dusty surface was littered with yellowing groundhog skulls (he had been studying rates of tooth decay in groundhogs ever since he joined the Department in 1897). At his back hung the frowning, bearded portrait of an extinct mammalogist who glared balefully down upon me. The smell of Formalin swirled about like the fetid breath of an undertaker&#x2019;s back parlor.<br><br>After a long silence, during which he toyed portentously with some of his skulls, my chief began his briefing. There was a solemnity about the occasion which would have done justice to the briefing of a special agent about to be entrusted with the assassination of a Head of State.<br><br>&#x201c;As you are aware, Lieutenant Mowat,&#x201d; my chief began, &#x201c;the <i>Canis lupus</i> problem has become one of national importance. Within this past year alone this Department has received no less than thirty-seven memoranda from Members of the House of Commons, all expressing the deep concern of their constituents that we ought to do something about the wolf. Most of the complaints have come from such civic-minded and disinterested groups as various Fish and Game clubs, while members of the business community &#x2013; in particular the manufacturers of some well-known brands of ammunition &#x2013; have lent their weight to the support of these legitimate grievances of the voting public of this Great Dominion, because their grievance is the complaint that the wolves are killing all the deer, and more and more of our fellow citizens are coming back from more and more hunts with less and less deer.<br><br>&#x201c;As you may possibly have heard, my predecessor supplied the Minister with an explanation of this situation in which it was his contention that there were fewer deer because the hunters had increased to the point where they outnumbered the deer about five to one. The Minister, in all good faith, read this fallacious statement in the House of Commons, and he was promptly shouted down by Members howling &#x2018;Liar!&#x2019; and &#x2018;Wolf-lover!&#x2019;<br><br>&#x201c;Three days later my predecessor retired to civilian life, and the Minister issued a press statement: &#x2018;The Department of Mines and Resources is determined to do everything in its power to curb the carnage being wreaked upon the deer population by hordes of wolves. A full-scale investigation of this vital problem, employing the full resources of the Department, is to be launched at once. The people of this country can rest assured that the Government of which I have the honor to be a member will leave no stone unturned to put an end to this intolerable situation.&#x2019;&#x201d;<br><br>At this ju...</p><h2>Waxcap Mushrooms of Eastern North America</h2><p>Members of the Hygrophoraceae family, commonly known as waxcaps, have long attracted the attention of mycologists and nature lovers. As a group, they are beautiful mushrooms. Those in the genus Hygrocybe are particularly colorful and eye-catching. Many waxcaps can be identified from field observations and macroscopic features of the fruiting bodies, further adding to their appeal for those lacking formal training in mycology. <br><br>Waxcaps are usually well represented in general mushroom field guides. There have also been thorough scientific treatments of the North American species. Excellent as these works may be, they are not comprehensive, nontechnical guides that illustrate the eastern North American waxcaps in color. The work presented here is not intended to be a scientific treatment of the Hygrophoraceae; rather, it fills a gap between the sporadic coverage in general mushroom field guides and the more inclusive technical monographs that typically lack color illustrations. <br><br>The geographical range of coverage includes eastern Canada, the United States east of the Great Plains and south to East Texas, the Gulf Coast, and Florida. Although the distribution of species is constantly being expanded as knowledge accumulates, most waxcaps that occur within this region are featured or discussed. <br><br>With over 150 color illustrations and detailed descriptions, this book is an indispensable reference guide for waxcap identification.</p><p>The Hygrophoraceae family of mushrooms, often called &#39;waxcaps,&#39; is well-known among amateurs and professionals because of its striking colors, stature, and general noticeability in the forest. This beautiful book is certainly the most complete field guide to this group of mushrooms in eastern North America. Bessette (emer., Utica College) and coauthors are all well-known mycologists, specializing in mushrooms, who have previously authored several other popular books on other groups of mushrooms. The introductory material is brief but appropriate for a field guide treatment of a rather specific, limited group of fungi. The principle sections are made up of the species descriptions and color photographs. The photos are perhaps the best collection of pictures of the Hygrophoraceae that has ever been assembled in print, at least of those species occurring in North America, and are very important for species identification. Approximately 160 species are treated; the fruiting body descriptions are thorough and scientific, complete with spore size and shape, taxonomic authority, synonyms, and etymology, making the book useful for a wide audience. A glossary, a list of additional readings, and an index to common and scientific names support the text. Overall, a very usable and beautiful book for both amateur and professional mushroom enthusiasts. Summing Up: Highly recommended. All levels/libraries. --D. L.

With extensive new scholarship based on original research and interviews with the artist, <i>Jasper Johns: Catalogue Raisonn� of Monotypes</i> provides the definitive account of his groundbreaking work in an intrinsically subversive medium situated between painting, drawing, and printmaking.<br> &nbsp;<br> Susan Dackerman and Jennifer L. Roberts examine Johns&#x2019;s innovative use of the printing press to create alterity, overturning monotype&#x2019;s long-standing reputation for subjectivity. Featured in this volume are all 143 monotypes Johns made between 1954 and June 2015, most of them published here for the first time. Each work is generously illustrated in color and accompanied by complete cataloguing information, including technical specifications, provenance, exhibition history, and bibliographic references.&nbsp;</p><p><b>Susan Dackerman </b>is Getty Scholar at the Getty Research Institute.<b> Jennifer L.

This new edition contains a DVD-ROM with over 400 still images and 250 edited video clips for much richer illustration than is possible with figures alone; an additional chapter describing the work that art therapists do; and new material on education with updated information on standards, ethics, and informing others. To further make the information accessible to practitioners, students, and teachers, the author has included a section on treatment planning and evaluation, an updated list of resources&nbsp;&#x2013; selected professional associations and proceedings &#x2013; references, expanded citations, and clinical vignettes and illustrations. Three key chapters describe and expand the work that art therapists do: "People We Help," deals with all ages; "Problems We Treat," focuses on different disorders and disabilities; and "Places We Practice," reflects the expansion of art therapy beyond its original home in psychiatry. The author&#x2019;s own introduction to the therapeutic power of art &#x2013; as a person, a worker, and a parent &#x2013; will resonate with both experienced and novice readers alike. Most importantly, however, this book provides a definition of art therapy that contains its history, diversity, challenges, and accomplishments. <br></p></p><p><p><strong>&#x201c;Rubin knows the story-telling power of images, whether conveyed in words or pictures&#x2015;moving or still.&nbsp; Students and professionals alike will enjoy this new edition with its clear, insightful writing, many illustrations, and an accompanying DVD to bring the topic of art therapy further to life.&#x201d;</strong> -&nbsp;<em>Randy M.

Yet, plainly, he was fired by outrage and a burning desire for a better world. This paradox is the starting point for <em>Marxism and Morality</em>. Discussing the positions taken by Marx, Engels, and their descendants in relation to certain moral issues, Steven Lukes addresses the questions on which Marxist thinkers and actors have taken a number of characteristic stands as well as other questions--personal relations and the moral virtues of the individual, for example--on which Marxism falls silent. A provocative exploration of the gray area where Marxism and morality meet, this book argues that Marxism makes a number of major moral claims and that its appeal has always been, in large part, a moral one.</p><p></p><h2>Kaplan and Sadock&#39;s Synopsis of Psychiatry: Behavioral Sciences/Clinical Psychiatry</h2><p>The best-selling general psychiatry text since 1972, <b>Kaplan and Sadock's Synopsis of Psychiatry</b> is now in its thoroughly updated Ninth Edition.

Extensive illustrations and examples quickly engage students in actual research problems, as the text carefully demonstrates how research and writing are interrelated processes. The authors focus on teaching the best research practices, illustrating how to choose the appropriate source and media for each type of problem. Electronic research is completely integrated into the text. Students are given solid guidance for every type of situation, learning when and how to choose between paper and electronic research, and how the choice among different media can result in different access means, scope, and currency of materials. The<b> Process of Legal Research</b> offers extensive, well-researched problems sets, ideal for large programs that need plenty of exercise options for their students. Pages with problems sets are perforated for easy use. <p></p> <p> The <b>Eighth Edition</b> finds a sharper focus on the basics, asking and answering the questions, "What are the various forms of legal authority?" and "How does each contribute to resolving a client's legal problem?"

Though the project was suspended after just one year because of World War II, Adams was still able to create quite a few astonishingly beautiful photographs of the American landscape.

His cold-blooded killing of a European Minister of War is an act of violence with chilling repercussions, not just for Raven himself but for the nation as a whole.

As he tracks down the agent who has been double-crossing him and attempts to elude the police, he becomes both hunter and hunted: an unwitting weapon of a strange kind of social justice.

In an unusually broad spectrum of essays, a distinguished group of international feminist scholars and activists explores the complexity of contemporary sexual politics around the globe. Using reproduction as an entry point in the study of social life and placing it at the center of social theory, the authors examine how cultures are produced, contested, and transformed as people imagine their collective future in the creation of the next generation.<br><br>The studies encompass a wide variety of subjects, from the impact of AIDS on reproduction in the United States to the aftereffects of Chernobyl on the Sami people in Norway and the impact of totalitarian abortion and birth control policies in Romania and China. The contributors use historical and comparative perspectives to illuminate the multiple and intersecting forms of power and resistance through which reproduction is given cultural weight and social form. They discuss the ways that seemingly distant influences shape and constrain local reproductive experiences such as the international flows of adoptive babies and childcare workers and the Victorian and imperial legacy of eugenics and family planning.</p><p>"<i>Conceiving the New World Order</i> promises to explore the consequences of making reproduction central to social theory in general, and it delivers on its promise abundantly. The feminist vision here is large, theoretically incisive, detailed, empirically deep, and politically inspiring. I will use these essays in teaching and research, but most of all in striving to inhabit the New World Order as a post-natal, born-again feminist."&#x2015;Donna Haraway, University of California, Santa Cruz<br><br>"A stunning collection that shifts the anthropology of reproduction onto the terrain of power, where it belongs. <i>Conceiving the New World Order</i> not only redefines reproduction by linking the body to the body politic but also shows the value of careful historical, social, and cultural analysis of the connection between the local and the global. It has much to teach anyone who wants to know how pregnancy, parenting, birth control, population policies, demography, and the new reproductive technologies shape and are shaped by women and the world."&#x2015;Lila Abu-Lughod, author of <i>Writing Women's Worlds: Bedouin Stories</i><b>Faye D.

Politicians take increasingly inflexible and extreme positions, leading to gridlock, partisan warfare, and the sense that our seats of government are nothing but cesspools of hypocrisy, childishness, and waste.&nbsp;The shocking reality, though, is that modern polarization was a deliberate project carried out by Democratic and Republican activists.<br><br> In <i>The Polarizers</i>, Sam Rosenfeld details why bipartisanship was seen as a problem in the postwar period and how polarization was then cast as the solution. Republicans and Democrats feared that they were becoming too similar, and that a mushy consensus imperiled their agendas and even American democracy itself. Thus began a deliberate move to match ideology with party label&#x2014;with the toxic results we now endure. Rosenfeld reveals the specific politicians, intellectuals, and operatives who worked together to heighten partisan discord, showing that our system today is not (solely) a product of gradual structural shifts but of deliberate actions motivated by specific agendas. Rosenfeld reveals that the story of Washington&#x2019;s transformation is both significantly institutional and driven by grassroots influences on both the left and the right.<br><br><i>The Polarizers</i> brilliantly challenges and overturns our conventional narrative about partisanship, but perhaps most importantly, it points us toward a new consensus: if we deliberately created today&#x2019;s dysfunctional environment, we can deliberately change it.</p><p><b>Sam Rosenfeld</b> is assistant professor of political science at Colgate University.&#x201c;For anyone who cares about our political future enough to learn from its past,&nbsp;<i>The Polarizers</i>&nbsp;is absolutely essential reading.&#x201d; (<i>Washington Monthly</i>)<br><br>&#x201c;A timely and significant contribution to the literature on political sorting and polarization that defines the current state of the two major American political parties. . . .A readable and well-structured history of our current party system. . .Highly recommended.&#x201d; (<i>Choice</i>)<br><br>&#x201c;Partisan and ideological polarization are defining features of our time, but they are more often denounced than understood. In <i>The Polarizers</i>, Rosenfeld sheds much-needed light on the origins of present-day politics&#x2014;revealing the human actors who took deliberate steps to bring about the political alignment we know today. His readable, deeply informed narrative should change the way we think about the recent past and even our own times, showing the era of polarization to be not a fall from grace but a plausible response to the very real problems and dilemmas of the old political order. Rosenfeld&#x2019;s new research and new insights brilliantly challenge much over-crusted conventional wisdom about polarization, and offers hints as to how conscious political action can help redress the flaws of the current party system much as past actors took steps to cure the ills of the past.&#x201d; (Matthew Yglesias <i>Vox, cofounder and senior correspondent</i>)<br><br>&#x201c;A delight for policy wonks and politicos, Rosenfeld's insightful study of the development of political parties since World War II is highly instructive for our current moment.&#x201d; (<i>Kirkus Reviews</i>)<br><br>&#x201c;As Sam Rosenfeld shows in&nbsp;<i>The Polarizers</i>, the irrational-seeming &#x201c;extreme partisanship&#x201d; and &#x201c;tribalism&#x201d; that contaminate our politics today originated in the principled efforts of writers, activists, and politicians who thought the two parties needed more polarization, ideological fixity, and internal discipline. . . .Today that course seems fatefully misguided, but Rosenfeld is right to point out that what came before wasn&#x2019;t always better. . . .Rosenfeld has very good pages on the 1964 Democratic convention, when members of the Mississippi Freedom Democratic Party, led by the activists Bob Moses and Fannie Lou Hamer, challenged the Dixiecrats.&#x201d; (Sam Tanenhaus <i>The New Republic</i>)<br><br>&#x201c;A thorough and detailed study that introduces readers to the&nbsp;myriad figures who contributed to&nbsp;the development of what Rosenfeld deems the &#x2018;polarization without responsibility&#x2019; of our present times.&#x201d; (<i>LSE Review of Books</i>)<br><br>&#x201c;To some political junkies, reading Sam Rosenfeld&#x2019;s book will be an exercise in almost unbearable nostalgia for that world of political stability and comity and the kind of genuine debate that can only come with mutual respect between those of differing political points of view. . .[<i>The Polarizers</i>] is a tribute to the meticulousness of his scholarship in reconstructing such a difficult and complicated history, one that was complicated, at least in part, deliberately.&#x201d; (<i>The Weekly Standard</i>)<br><br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;ve read a lot of books on polarization, and Rosenfeld&#x2019;s is the best I&#x2019;ve seen at painting a picture of what American politics looked like before Republican meant conservative and Democrat meant liberal, and why polarization seemed like a good, necessary thing to many of the people who drove it.&#x201d; (Ezra Klein <i>cofounder and editor-at-large</i>)<br><br>&#x201c;A remarkable achievement. . .As a political history of the post&#x2013;World War II era, <i>The Polarizers</i> provides a comprehensive analysis of both parties&#x2019; development. The fact that Rosenfeld manages to cover both parties in this regard is impressive.&#x201d; (<i>The Journal of Politics</i>)<br><br>&#x201c;We live in a polarized nation, and we vote in polarized elections. Sam Rosenfeld, in his excellent&nbsp;<i>The Polarizers</i>, shows us how we got here. . . .

Unnikrishna Pillai of Polytechnic University. The book is intended for a senior/graduate level course in probability and is aimed at students in electrical engineering, math, and physics departments. The authors&#39; approach is to develop the subject of probability theory and stochastic processes as a deductive discipline and to illustrate the theory with basic applications of engineering interest. Approximately 1/3 of the text is new material--this material maintains the style and spirit of previous editions. In order to bridge the gap between concepts and applications, a number of additional examples have been added for further clarity, as well as several new topics.</p><p>This text is a classic in probability, statistics, and estimation and in the application of these fields to modern engineering problems. <i>Probability, Random Variables, and Stochastic Processes</i> assumes a strong college mathematics background. The first half of the text develops the basic machinery of probability and statistics from first principles while the second half develops applications of the basic theory. Topics in the first section include probability distributions and densities, random variables and vectors, expectations, covariance, correlations, functions of random variables and vectors, and conditional distributions and densities. In this third edition of the text, the second half of the book has been substantially updated and expanded to include new or revised discussions of the following topics: mean square estimation, likelihood tests, maximum entropy methods, Monte Carlo techniques, spectral representations and estimation, sampling theory, bispectra and system identification, cyclostationary processes, deterministic signals in noise, and the Wiener and Kalman filters. <i>Probability, Random Variables, and Stochastic Processes</i> covers a remarkable density of material and the clarity of both presentation and notation make this book invaluable as a text and a reference.S.

It has intrigued researchers and visitors for more than a century. But "Mesa Verde" represents more than cliff dwellings--its peoples created a culture that thrived for a thousand years in Southwestern Colorado and southeastern Utah. Archaeologists have discovered dozens of long-buried hamlets and villages spread for miles across the Great Sage Plain west and north of Mesa Verde. Only lately have these sites begun to reveal their secrets.</p><p>In recent decades, archaeologists have been working intensively in the Mesa Verde region to build the story of its ancestral Pueblo inhabitants. <em>The Mesa Verde World</em> showcases new findings about the region's prehistory, environment, and archaeological history, from newly discovered reservoir systems on Mesa Verde to astronomical alignments at Yellow Jacket Pueblo. Key topics include farming, settlement, sacred landscapes, cosmology and astronomy, rock art, warfare, migration, and contemporary Pueblo perspectives.</p></p><p>This beautiful, well written, and informative book...with its many photographs, illustrations, and maps is...[a] lavishly illustrated...useful collection of ideas, images, and interpretations [that] successfully highlights what contemporary archaeologists, researchers, and descendent community members know or have learned about the Ancestral Pueblos of the Mesa Verde Region. David Grant Noble&#39;s gift for anticipating what interested readers want and need to know about a given archaeological area clearly shines forth in this collection, and his choice of writers and topics are excellent. [E]ach author seems to have been encouraged to present his or her data and methods in such a way as to involve the reader in the debate or nurture the reader&#39;s imagination. --Carla R.

For Mr Bennet, a quiet life is to be highly commended. For Mrs Bennet, finding eligible husbands for her five daughters is the most important of a mother's duties. For Elizabeth, marrying without affection is unthinkable. But for them all, life is about to change when a handsome young man and his equally handsome and wealthy companion, take residence nearby.<br><br>Grand country estates, beautiful women, and eligible young men all play their part in this unforgettable story that has delighted readers for 200 years. A story where comedy, heartache and romance interweave to make <i>Pride and Prejudice</i>&nbsp;one of the most popular and enduring novels in the English language.</p><p>Jane Austen was born in the small village of Steventon in Hampshire on 16th December 1775. She was the seventh of eight children and throughout her life was especially close to her only sister, Cassandra. Jane never married and only once, very briefly, was engaged. In 1814, giving advice to a niece, and echoing Jane Bennet in Pride and Prejudice, she wrote, "Anything is to be preferred or endured rather than marrying without affection." She was 36 before her first novel was published and during her lifetime she made little more than �700 from her writing. Her novels, however, have proved enduringly popular, and since 1833 have never been out of print. Jane became ill in 1816 and died in the arms of her sister on 18th July 1817. She was 41 years old. Cassandra wrote, "I have lost such a sister, such a friend as can never have been surpassed... She was the sun of my life." Four of Jane's novels were published during her lifetime: <i>Sense and Sensibility</i>&nbsp;(1811), <i>Pride and Prejudice&nbsp;</i>(1813), <i>Mansfield Park</i> (1814) and <i>Emma</i> (1816). <i>Northanger Abbey</i> and <i>Persuasion</i> were published posthumously in 1818.Gr 8 Up&#x2014;Set in a time in which women were at the mercy of the arrangements made for them by their families, this story of the romantic courtship of Darcy and Elizabeth will resonate with readers. Though this adaptation conveys the language of the time and the story is true to form, the artwork lacks a certain appeal. There are some instances where characters are indiscernible and lack definition. However, the flow of the story is easy to follow, making it a good resource for students who find Austen difficult to decipher. Pairing this version with Nancy Butler's Pride &amp; Prejudice (Marvel, 2009) would make a great lesson on comparing and contrasting revisions and adaptations. Students interested in Austen may read this title of their own accord, but others will need to be led to it.&#x2014;Mariela Siegert, Westfield Middle School, Bloomingdale, IL</p><h2>Long Ago in France: The Years in Dijon (DESTINATIONS)</h2><p>Recounts the author&#39;s three year stay in Dijon before the outbreak of World War II, and details the people encountered there</p><p>Mary Frances Kennedy Fisher (1908-1992) is the author of sixteen books of essays and reminiscences, many of which have become American classics. Her books include &#34;The Gastronomical Me &#34;and &#34;How to Cook a Wolf&#34;. In 1991, she was elected to the American Academy and Institute of Arts and Letters.Fisher spent three years in Dijon in the halcyon days between the wars. This is a brief and wholly delightful memoir of that time, an account rich with wines, meals, and crisply etched portraits. Fisher has often been categorized as a food writer--as if cooking and eating were activities somehow apart from life. Here she writes just as exuberantly of her monstrously vital landlady as she does of disintegrating snipe roasted on "toast softened with the paste of their rotted innards." Jan Morris reminds us in her introduction that W.H. Auden called Fisher's prose the best in America, a verdict this volume comes close to confirming.

Paul Avrich shows how eight anarchists who were blamed for the bombing at a workers' meeting near Chicago's Haymarket Square became the focus of a variety of passionately waged struggles.</p></p><p>"What makes [this book] so valuable is that Avrich has shown us a time when anarchism breathed life into American politics, and not simply when it drew its last breath in Chicago."

Jessie would like to participate, but she just bought an ice-cream cone and has only 39 cents left. Fortunately, there is a penny pot where children put their extra change, so Jessie sits down to wait. As the youngsters approach the booth, their money is counted out and their extra pennies are added to the pot. When Jessie adds up the change and finds that there is 51 cents, she can finally get her face painted to look like a cat. The counting of money becomes a real experience in this appealing story; life-size, authentic-looking coins are used in the brightly colored illustrations, which also show multiethnic children having a good time.

Now it's time to do the same for geometry. Mark Driscoll, author of the powerful and popular <i>Fostering Algebraic Thinking,</i> takes up the challenge and leads you to new, research-based ways to improve how your students conceptualize and apply geometric ideas. With <i>Fostering Geometric Thinking </i>any math teacher can discover essential, practical ideas for helping students cultivate <b>geometric habits of mind</b> that lead to success in this crucial mathematical subject. The book focuses on rigorous, problem-based teaching that encourages students to deepen their thinking in three key geometric strands: <ul> <li>geometric properties </li> <li>geometric transformations </li> <li>measurement of geometric objects.</li> </ul> <i>Fostering Geometric Thinking </i>shows you how the interplay of these strands helps students devise multiple solutions and develop a broader sense of geometric principles. It's loaded with helpful resources, including: <ul> <li>engaging problems to use in your classroom</li> <li>examples of student solutions to these problems</li> <li>transcripts of classroom interactions</li> <li>a DVD featuring in-the-field footage of students working through open-ended problems highlighted in the book.</li> </ul> Geometry is a vital component of mathematical understanding, and it's time that it received the same attention that algebra and statistics do. With engaging problems and straightforward suggestions that can help students deepen, recognize, and describe their thinking, <i>Fostering Geometric Thinking </i>is the resource you need to ensure that when it comes to geometry, your students know all the angles.</p><p>Mark Driscoll is a nationally recognized leader in mathematics education who designs instructional resources and professional development materials that build mathematics teachers&#39; capacity to enhance students&#39; understanding and improve their learning outcomes.

Calhoun were widely seen as the foremost statemen of their age. In the decades preceding the Civil War, they dominated American congressional politics as no other figures did, and there was scarcely a national issue or debate in which they took no part. Now Merrill D. Peterson, one of our most gifted historians, brilliantly re-creates the lives and times of these great men in this monumental collective biography.<br> Arriving on the national scene at the onset of the War of 1812 and departing political life during the ordeal of the Union in 1850-52, Webster, Clay, and Calhoun opened--and closed--a new era in American politics. In outlook and style, they represented startling contrasts: Webster, the Federalist and staunch New England defender of the Union; Clay, the "war hawk" and National Rebublican leader from the West; Calhoun, the youthful nationalist who became the foremost spokesman of the South and slavery. In 1832, when they came together in the Senate for the first time, united in their opposition of Andrew Jackson, the idea of the "Great Triumvirate" was born. The idea survived and entered the history books because these men divided so much of American politics for so long between them.<br> Peterson brings to life the great events in which the Triumvirate figured so prominently: the debates on Clay's American System, the Missouri Compromise, the Webster-Hayne debate, the Bank War, the Webster-Ashburton Treaty, the annexation of Texas, the Compromise of 1850. At once a sweeping narrative and a penetrating study of non-presidential leadership, this book offers an indelible picture of the era--a conservative age in which statesmen saw their principal mission as preserving the legacy of free government received from the Founding Fathers. And, as Peterson shows us in fascinating detail, Webster, Clay, and Calhoun were the prime exemplars of three facets of this national mind.</p><p>Peterson brings to life the great events in which the Triumvirate figures so Prominently.<br><em>About the Author</em><br><strong>Merrill D.

With this work, he created the history of philosophy as a scientific study. He reveals philosophical theory as neither an accident nor an artificial construct, but as an exemplar of its age, fashioned by its antecedents and contemporary circumstances, and serving as a model for the future. The author himself appears to have regarded this book as a popular introduction to his philosophy as a whole, and it remains the most readable and accessible of all his philosophical writings.<br>Eschewing the methods of original history (written during the period in question) and reflective history (written after the period has passed), Hegel embraces philosophic history, which employs a priori philosophical thought to interpret history as a rational process. Reason rules history, he asserts, through its infinite freedom (being self-sufficient, it depends on nothing beyond its own laws and conclusions) and power (through which it forms its own laws). Hegel argues that all of history is caused and guided by a rational process, and God's seemingly unknowable plan is rendered intelligible through philosophy. The notion that reason rules the world, he concludes, is both necessary to the practice of philosophic history and a conclusion drawn from that practice.</p><p>Here is one volume is an important series of the lectures of philosopher Georg Hegel on the philosophy of history, including: <p>* "Original History" <br>* "Reflective History" <br>* "Philosophical History" <br>* "Reason Governs the World" <br>* "Essential Destiny of Reason" <br>* "The Abstract Characteristics of the Nature of Spirit" <br>* "The Means Spirit Uses to Realize Its Idea" <br>* "The Embodiment Spirit Assumes - the State" <br>* and more. </p><p>This essential volume belongs in the library of all students of philosophy and of 19th-century intellectualism.</p>Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel (1770-1831) was a German philosopher and a major figure in German Idealism.<br></p><h2>Understanding Psychology (10th Edition)</h2><p><p> <b> <i>Continuing Attention to Enduring Issues in Psychology</i> </b> </p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p> <i>Understanding Psychology, 10th </i> edition highlights the enduring issues that cut across and unite all subfields of psychology- Person-Situation, Nature-Nurture, Stability-Change, Diversity-Universality, and Mind-Body- to show students the surprising unity and coherence of the diverse and exciting science of psychology.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>This 14-chapter program presents a scientific, accurate, and current overview of the fundamental concepts of psychology in a clear and accessible language, with significant emphasis on applications of psychology.

This groundbreaking anthology is the first to pull together both the foundational writings in the field and more recent scholarship on the cultural and racial politics of schooling. A comprehensive introduction provides an overview of the history and tenets of CRT in education.

"It's the animal in us," we often hear when we've been bad. But why not when we're good? <i>Primates and Philosophers</i> tackles this question by exploring the biological foundations of one of humanity's most valued traits: morality.</p><br><p> In this provocative book, renowned primatologist Frans de Waal argues that modern-day evolutionary biology takes far too dim a view of the natural world, emphasizing our "selfish" genes and reinforcing our habit of labeling ethical behavior as humane and the less civilized as animalistic. Seeking the origin of human morality not in evolution but in human culture, science insists that we are moral by choice, not by nature.</p><br><p> Citing remarkable evidence based on his extensive research of primate behavior, de Waal attacks "Veneer Theory," which posits morality as a thin overlay on an otherwise nasty nature. He explains how we evolved from a long line of animals that care for the weak and build cooperation with reciprocal transactions. Drawing on Darwin, recent scientific advances, and his extensive research of primate behavior, de Waal demonstrates a strong continuity between human and animal behavior. He probes issues such as anthropomorphism and human responsibilities toward animals. His compelling account of how human morality evolved out of mammalian society will fascinate anyone who has ever wondered about the origins and reach of human goodness.</p><br><p> Based on the Tanner Lectures de Waal delivered at Princeton University's Center for Human Values in 2004, <i>Primates and Philosophers</i> includes responses by the philosophers Peter Singer, Christine M. Korsgaard, and Philip Kitcher and the science writer Robert Wright. They press de Waal to clarify the differences between humans and other animals, yielding a lively debate that will fascinate all those who wonder about the origins and reach of human goodness.</p></p><p><p>"Frans de Waal has achieved that state of grace for a scientist--doing research that is both rigorous and wildly creative, and in the process has redefined how we think about the most interesting realms of behavior among nonhuman primates--cooperation, reconciliation, a sense of fairness, and even the rudiments of morality. In these Tanner lectures and the subsequent dialogue with leading philosophers and evolutionary psychologists, de Waal takes this knowledge to redefine how we think of morality in another primate, namely ourselves. This is superb and greatly challenging thinking."--<b>Robert M. Sapolsky, author of <i>Why Zebras Don't Get Ulcers</i> and <i>A Primate's Memoir</i></b></p><p>"On the basis of a fascinating and provocative account of the remarkable continuities between the social emotions of humans and of nonhuman primates, de Waal develops a compelling case--which moral philosophers would do well to take seriously--for the evolutionary roots of human morality. In addition, he and his commentators conduct an illuminating discussion of some fundamental methodological and ethical issues--such as whether it is necessarily illicit to characterize animal behavior 'anthropomorphically,' and whether it is reasonable to attribute 'rights' to animals. Anyone who is interested in these issues, and especially those interested in the sources of human morality, will find this book exceptionally challenging and worthwhile."--<b>Harry Frankfurt, author of <i>On Bullshit</i></b></p><p>"Frans de Waal is the perfect guide to the emerging data on moral-like behavior in animals. Strengthened by deep sensitivity to the complexity of social relations and by a strong defense of anthropomorphism, this book shows how evolutionary biology can contribute to moral philosophy not merely through general principles, but by specific phylogenetic comparisons. It is a major advance in the socialization of ethology."--<b>Richard Wrangham, Harvard University, coauthor of <i>Demonic Males: Apes and the Origins of Human Violence</i></b></p><p>"Here, Frans de Waal, the world's leading researcher on primate behavior, a highly reflective thinker, and a skilled writer, presents the fruits of thirty years of empirical research.

The multilingual Baraga quickly learned the Ojibway language and over many years worked within the community to produce a dictionary, a grammar and religious literature. In 1853 the first edition of A Dictionary of Otchipwe Language Explained in English was published. A revised edition of this Ojibway-English/English-Ojibway dictionary followed in 1878 and is the version now reprinted. More than a hundred years later, this dictionary remains a classic and the most useful for a wide range of dialects. It is an important cultural and linguistic source for historians, anthropologists, linguists, ethnologists, and all students interested in the Ojibway language.</p><p>Frederic BaragaText: English</p><h2>Cowboy Ethics: What It Takes to Win at Life</h2><p><b>Frustrated by an epidemic of misbehavior, corporate management teams are going back to the idea that personal character and individual responsibility are the ultimate keys to integrity business&#x2014;just as they were back in the days of the Open Range.</b><br><br>When first published, <i>Cowboy Ethics</i> inspired businesspeople to look to the Code of the West.

On the eve of the war, public mental hospitals were the chief element in the American mental health system. Responsible for providing both treatment and care and supported by major portions of state budgets, they employed more than two-thirds of the members of the American Psychiatric Association and cared for nearly 98 percent of all institutionalized patients. This study shows how the consensus for such a program vanished, creating social problems that tragically intensified the sometimes unavoidable devastation of mental illness. Examining changes in mental health care between 1940 and 1970, Grob shows that community psychiatric and psychological services grew rapidly, while new treatments enabled many patients to lead normal lives. Acute services for the severely ill were expanded, and public hospitals, relieved of caring for large numbers of chronic or aged patients, developed into more active treatment centers. But since the main goal of the new policies was to serve a broad population, many of the most seriously ill were set adrift without even the basic necessities of life. By revealing the sources of the euphemistically designated policy of "community care," Grob points to sorely needed alternatives.</p><p>Originally published in 1991.</p><p>The <b>Princeton Legacy Library</b> uses the latest print-on-demand technology to again make available previously out-of-print books from the distinguished backlist of Princeton University Press.

With sly humor and lucid insight, Laura Shapiro uncovers our ancestors widespread obsession with food, and in doing so, tells us why we think as we do about food today. This edition includes a new Introduction by Michael Stern, who, with Jane Stern, is the author of Gourmet magazine's popular column <i>Roadfood</i> and the book <b>Eat Your Way Across the U.S.A.</b><br></p><p>Perfection Salad, a dish that won its creator first prize in a 1905 cooking contest, consisted of pristine molded aspic containing celery, red pepper, and chopped cabbage. Laura Shapiro, author of this eponymous social history, part of the Modern Library Food series, takes the salad as a model for the domestic science movement, an intriguing women's crusade of the late 19th and early 20th centuries. Bent on convincing housewives that the way to domestic order lay in cooking "dainty" nutritional meals from sanitary ingredients in "scientific" kitchens, the movement helped give birth to our mass-market food scene, with its reliance on home economics precepts, processed convenience foods, and no-cook cooking--our cuisine of boil-in bags and microwave frozen dinners. Entertaining and informative, but also unexpectedly moving, the book chronicles in numerous intriguing stories the ways in which an impulse to liberate women from the drudgery and imprecision of daily food preparation led to its debasement. It's a fascinating story, of interest to anyone who wonders why and how we cook and eat--and think about food--as we do.<p> Beginning with portraits of early domestic movement reformers such as Catherine Beecher and Mary Lincoln, and investigating institutions like the Boston Cooking School, home of Fannie Farmer, the Mother of Level Measurements, the book then pursues "scientific cookery" into its mid-20th-century manifestation. "With the help of the new industry of advertising," Shapiro writes, "the food business was able to reflect Mrs. Lincoln's values [of food-production uniformity] by keeping its achievements in packing, sanitation, convenience, and novelty at the forefront." But greater ills ensued: the effect of the reformers, Shapiro contends, was to encourage women to become docile consumers tethered to commercial interests--and to rob our vigorous cooking and eating traditions of their rich life. In making that point, <i>Perfection Salad</i> reveals its true subject: the cultural priorities that defined American 20th-century life and, finally, the sorry nature of the order they established. <i>--Arthur Boehm</i></p>Laura Shapiro was an award-winning writer at <i>Newsweek</i> for more than fifteen years.

Whether writing fact or fiction, Abbey was always an autobiographer. Each of the thirty-five selections presented here, arranged chronologically by date of incident (not of publication), demonstrates that Abbey was passionately, insistently his own man. As poet-farmer Wendell Berry puts it: &#34;He remains Edward Abbey, speaking as and for himself, fighting, literally, for dear life ... for the survival not only of nature, but of human nature, of culture, as only our heritage of works and hopes can define it&#34;. To speak for the voiceless was his mission. He was a virtuoso of the well-phrased thought in which style and content, symbol and meaning - each imbued with humor - come together to defy the powerful, reminding us always that preservation of wild nature is a key to a free spirit. And along with Emerson and Thoreau, Abbey, the uncompromising stylist, knew that the corruption of language follows the corruption of man. &#34;Language&#34;, Abbey wrote, &#34;seeks to transcend itself, &#39;to grasp the thing that has no name.&#39;&#34;<p><b>Edward Abbey</b> was born in 1927 in Pennsylvania.

Across divides of language, religion, region, and history, ordinary women and men felt a common attachment to &#x201c;their empire,&#x201d; while bureaucrats, soldiers, politicians, and academics devised inventive solutions to the challenges of governing Europe&#x2019;s second largest state. In the decades before and after its dissolution, some observers belittled the Habsburg Empire as a dysfunctional patchwork of hostile ethnic groups and an anachronistic imperial relic. Judson examines their motives and explains just how wrong these rearguard critics were.</p><p>Rejecting fragmented histories of nations in the making, this bold revision surveys the shared institutions that bridged difference and distance to bring stability and meaning to the far-flung empire. By supporting new schools, law courts, and railroads, along with scientific and artistic advances, the Habsburg monarchs sought to anchor their authority in the cultures and economies of Central Europe. A rising standard of living throughout the empire deepened the legitimacy of Habsburg rule, as citizens learned to use the empire&#x2019;s administrative machinery to their local advantage. Nationalists developed distinctive ideas about cultural difference in the context of imperial institutions, yet all of them claimed the Habsburg state as their empire.</p><p>The empire&#x2019;s creative solutions to governing its many lands and peoples&#x2015;as well as the intractable problems it could not solve&#x2015;left an enduring imprint on its successor states in Central Europe. Its lessons remain no less important today.</p></p><p>Pieter M. Judson is Professor of Nineteenth- and Twentieth-Century History at the European University Institute in Florence, Italy.&#x201c;Pieter M. Judson&#x2019;s book informs and stimulates. If his account of Habsburg achievements, especially in the 18th century, is rather starry-eyed, it is a welcome corrective to the black legend usually presented. Lucid, elegant, full of surprising and illuminating details, it can be warmly recommended to anyone with an interest in modern European history.&#x201d;<b><i>&#x2015;</i></b><b>Tim Blanning</b><b>, </b><b><i>Wall Street Journal</i></b><br><br>&#x201c;This is an engaging reappraisal of the empire whose legacy, a century after its collapse in 1918, still resonates across the nation-states that replaced it in central Europe. Judson rejects conventional depictions of the Habsburg empire as a hopelessly dysfunctional assemblage of squabbling nationalities and stresses its achievements in law, administration, science and the arts.&#x201d;<b><i>&#x2015;</i></b><b>Tony Barber</b><b>, </b><b><i>Financial Times</i></b><br><br>&#x201c;<i>The Habsburg Empire</i> is Judson&#x2019;s attempt at a grand, unified history of Austria-Hungary for our times...Habsburg history is not the same after this book.&#x201d;<b><i>&#x2015;</i></b><b>Natasha Wheatley</b><b>, </b><b><i>London Review of Books</i></b><br><br>&#x201c;Indispensable to any serious library.&#x201d;<b><i>&#x2015;</i></b><b>Simon Heffer</b><b>, </b><b><i>Daily Telegraph</i></b><br><br>&#x201c;Judson&#x2019;s reflections on nations, states and institutions are of broader interest, not least in the current debate on the future of the European Union after Brexit.

Although he did not live to complete the work, he left detailed plans for the last third of this absorbingly plotted novel which were faithfully executed by his colleague, the popular author Walter Besant. The novel is set during the Irish Land War of the early 1880s and tells the story of Iris Henley, an independent young woman who marries the &#x201c;wild&#x201d; Lord Harry Norland, a member of an Irish secret society, and becomes unhappily drawn into a conspiracy plot. </p> <p> The Broadview edition of <em>Blind Love</em> includes a critical introduction and primary source materials that address the novel&#x2019;s focus on movements for Irish independence. Appendices include newspaper accounts of Ireland during the Land War and of the fraud case on which Collins based his story, articles reacting to Collins&#x2019;s sudden death, <em>Punch</em> cartoons depicting the English attitudes toward the Irish, and contemporary reviews. </p>English novelist and playwright Wilkie Collins was a prolific writer with a body of work comprising thirty novels, over sixty short stories, more than a dozen plays, and a wide range of non-fiction pieces. Collins is best known for his novels The Woman in White, an early sensation novela genre combining shocking gothic horror with everyday domestic settingsand The Moonstone, which is credited as one of the first modern mystery novels. In the 1850s Collins met Charles Dickens and the two struck up a friendship, which lead to Collins becoming a frequent contributor to Dickens s journals Household Words and All the Year Round. Many of his stories have been adapted for film, including Basil, A Terribly Strange Bed, The Moonstone and The Woman in White. Collins died in 1889 at the age of 65.</p><h2>The Elements of Drawing</h2><p>Provides a comprehensive explanation of techniques for both the professional artist and the student.</p><p>Can drawing&#x2014;sound, honest representation of the world as the eye sees it, not tricks with the pencil or a few&nbsp;"effects"&#x2014;be learned from a book? One of the most gifted draftsmen, who is also one of the greatest art critics and theorists of all time, answers that question with a decided "Yes." He is John Ruskin, the author of this book, a classic in art education as well as a highly effective text for the student and amateur today.<br>The work is in three parts, cast in the form of letters to a student, successively covering "First Practice," "Sketching from Nature," and "Colour and Composition." Starting with the bare fundamentals (what kind of drawing pen to buy; shading a square evenly), and using the extremely practical method of exercises which the student performs from the very first, Ruskin instructs, advises, guides, counsels, and anticipates problems with sensitivity. The exercises become more difficult, developing greater and greater skills until Ruskin feels his reader is ready for watercolors and finally composition, which he treats in detail as to the laws of principality, repetition, continuity, curvature, radiation, contrast, interchange, consistency, and harmony. All along the way, Ruskin explains, in plain, clear language, the artistic and craftsmanlike <i>reasons</i> behind his practical advice&#x2014;underlying which, of course, is Ruskin's brilliant philosophy of honest, naturally observed art which has so much affected our aesthetic.<br>Three full-page plates and 48 woodcuts and diagrams (the latter from drawings by the author) show the student what the text describes. An appendix devotes many pages to the art works which may be studied with profit.<br>Unabridged republication of the text from the Library edition of <i>The Works of John&nbsp;Ruskin,</i> 1904.&nbsp;From his early youth John Ruskin drew obsessively, a discipline<br>that he not only kept up right through the production of his great<br>literary works, but which was essential to them. This book is the<br>result of quite considerable teaching experience - Ruskin had been<br>giving informal lessons by letter to friends for some time, for he<br>could never resist giving advice; and he also taught more formal<br>classes at the Working Men's college, a duty he shared with Rossetti.<br>It was as a sort of distillation of all this experience that The Elements of Drawing was born; and also from his development as a draughtsman.</p><h2>Collaborative Treatment of Traumatized Children and Teens, First Edition: The Trauma Systems Therapy Approach</h2><p><p>For too many traumatized children and their families, chronic stressors such as poverty, substance abuse, and family or community violence&#x2014;coupled with an overburdened care system&#x2014;pose seemingly insurmountable barriers to treatment.

Putnam, MD, Cincinnati Children&#x2019;s Medical Center<br><br>"This impressive work, representing a collaboration of child psychiatry and psychology, exemplifies the next generation of treatment manuals. The authors' approach goes beyond a narrow focus on psychopathology to encompass the social, interpersonal, and environmental contexts in which it occurs. The book incorporates the latest thinking on everything from the neurobiological effects of trauma to the disorganized social systems that may exacerbate these effects. This clearly outlined, step-by-step treatment approach will be invaluable for all clinicians dealing with trauma in the difficult social contexts where it most often occurs. Every child clinician will want to be familiar with this approach."--David H. Barlow, PhD, Boston University<br><br>"Trauma Systems Therapy provides an elegant way to systematize intervention planning for complex trauma cases, whose multiplicity of problems can often overwhelm the clinician's ability to think clearly and set priorities. Anyone working with families with difficult, unstable lives will appreciate the lucid, clear approach contained in this valuable manual.

Keane, PhD, National Center for PTSD, VA Boston Healthcare System and Boston University<br><br><br>"The authors adopt a broad definition of trauma, including issues such as ongoing stress, poverty, family and community violence, and parental mental illness and substance misuse. This inclusivity makes the book realistic and relevant to a wide range of child and adolescent groups....A valuable resource that strikes the balance well between just the right amount of jargon-free theory and maintaining its focus on practical issues. The book is friendly and easy to read....Here is a book that offers a model that moves theory to practice in order to help all of us who endeavour to treat, support, and care for traumatised children and adolescents."

(<i>Family Journal</i> 2009-06-20)<br><br>"The book is clearly written and with multiple icon keys and case studies so that it takes the form of a well-developed treatment manual....This is an excellent volume, particularly for the front-line provider interested in a manualized hands-on introduction to interventions with traumatized children, teens, and their families." (<i>Archives of Pediatrics and Adolescent Medicine</i> 2009-06-20)<br><br>"An insightful and organized guide to the treatment of childhood trauma and can be used by professionals in a myriad of settings and at any stage in their professional development....The authors provide helpful advice on the treatment of childhood traumatic stress that can be used by clinicians, teachers, social service workers, lawyers, administrators, policy makers, students, parents, as well as teenagers who have experienced trauma. This tool helps guide individuals in the treatment of children as well as in the coordination of services under a financially constrained system of care.... The book is effectively written in a friendly, interactive, and readable style aimed at a broader audience....Saxe, Ellis, and Kaplow have spent almost a decade developing this exemplary tool for those involved in the treatment of and advocacy for children suffering from traumatic stress. This book can be an invaluable guide to people in the beginning of their careers as well as to experts in the field." (<i>Journal of the American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry</i> 2009-06-20)<br><br>"This is a very important book for anyone working with abused and neglected children and their care system....To assist the reader, not only is the book laid out carefully, it also contains copious tables exemplifying assessments and examples of questions to assess various elements of their treatment....It addresses an underserved population, often with vexing problems in great need. Saxe, Ellis, and Kaplow have done a salutary job detailing their treatment paradigm and organizing it in a highly readable, comprehensive, and thorough manner. Their many years of focused work had enabled them to take this challenging issue and present it with clarity, organization and detail. Their presentation is highly effective. Any social service organization and all psychologists, social workers, psychiatric nurses, and psychiatrists working with traumatized and especially urban traumatized children will find this book very valuable....Any graduate psychology program that seeks to work with underserved, urban or other challenging populations should give this book serious consideration as an addition to the course syllabus."

This is a practical treatment manual that incorporates all of the major techniques or practice elements used in proven trauma treatments....Saxe and colleagues have organized their book to be easily accessible for busy clinicians and other mental health workers who may find it difficult to tackle denser textbooks....the language is clear and forthright, without a lot of jargon, and the description of the techniques are simple and understandable. This book should be a helpful resource for training staff who are new to the field to work with traumatized young people....I really like this book. I recommend it highly for clinicians working in children's mental health and for students in this field. In fact, I have been trying to find a way to buy copies for all of our state's contracted provider agencies, because I think they all could improve their practice by using at least some aspects of this approach. Although the book focuses on intensive outpatient treatment settings, the approach clearly could be applied in many of the other settings that make up our array of services, such as therapeutic group home or foster home programs."

An emphasis on subregions (places within regions) enables readers to explore specific locales. An economic development themeoffers a more conceptual treatment than the traditional coverage of this topic. <br> Basic Concepts and Ideas; The United States and Canada; Latin America and the Caribbean; Europe; Northern Eurasia; Central Asia and Afghanistan; The Middle East and North Africa; Africa South of the Sahara; South Asia; East Asia; Southeast Asia; Australia, New Zealand, and the Pacific Islands.<br> A useful reference for anyone who wants to learn more about the different regions of the world. <br> <br></p><p>David Clawson is a Professor Emeritus of Geography in the College of Liberal Arts, University of New Orleans. He has a B.A. from the University of Utah, and an M.A. and Ph.D. from the University of Florida. He has served as&nbsp; Chair of the Department of Geography and as Director of the Latin American Studies Program at the University of New Orleans.

For many, these are the best of times, with rapid advances in health care extending human life expectancies to record high levels and material comforts that were unheard of even a generation ago now being commonplace. It is easy in such conditions to overlook the fact that most of the world's people live in less industrialized regions characterized by hunger, malnutrition, poor health, and limited educational and economic opportunities. Many also live under circumstances of restricted personal freedom owing to political, racial, religious, or gender-based prejudice. What is even more troubling is the fact that the income gap between the technologically more developed and less developed nations is increasing. </p> <p> The purpose of this volume is to introduce students to the geographical foundations of development and underdevelopment and to help us recognize the contributions that the study of geography can make to environmentally and culturally sustainable development. As we study the lives of others through this text, we will learn not only about them but also come to better understand ourselves. We will come to realize further that development, or the improvement of the human condition, consists of far more than increased economic output and that each person and society contributes in a positive way to the cultural diversity and richness of the earth. </p> <p> College students are in a unique position to increase their understanding of the world and to use that knowledge to benefit themselves and others. Through the study of world regional geography, we begin to comprehend the issues involved in the pursuit of world peace, preservation of the environment, improved health, and higher levels of living. In fact, the Association of American Geographers, the National Geographic Society, the American Geographical Society, and the National Council for Geographic Education have devoted significant resources and effort to improving geographic awareness. Even the U.S. Congress has cited geographic education as critical to understanding our increasingly interdependent world. </p> <p> This eighth edition of <i>World Regional Geography</i> is dedicated to college students who are seeking a better understanding of our complex and challenging world. It is written for both majors and nonmajors and does not require an extensive background in geography. The basic regional structure of the seventh edition has been retained, including a multiple author approach that permits each region to be discussed by a scholar who is an expert in that area. Although our regional specializations vary, we are united in our dedication to expanding geographical awareness and to contributing to the development of the peoples of both the more and less industrialized nations. </p> <p> <i>World Regional Geography</i> opens with four chapters that consider geography as a discipline, population and resources, physical and cultural elements of the environment, and the world condition as it relates to economic and human development. Eight additional parts&#x2014;organized into twenty-three chapters&#x2014;follow, structured within a regional framework. Within this regional framework, students are introduced to basic geographical and developmental concepts. </p> <p> Although the use of this text as an entity is encouraged, its organization allows a variety of teaching strategies. As time requires, sections treating historical or environmental processes, or specific regions, can be selectively emphasized or deleted. In a two-term sequence, the book facilitates consideration along continental or regional divisions or along the lines of more industrialized-less industrialized countries. The suggested further readings at the end of each part can then be used to supplement the text; table and figure references can encourage students to pursue external data sources and analysis. </p> <p> <i>World Regional Geography</i> contains numerous features that are designed to assist and stimulate students: </p> <ul> <li>More than 200 full-color maps and diagrams have been rendered by a professional cartographic studio, incorporating the latest boundary and name changes and physical, cultural, and economic data. The maps are carefully integrated into the text in order to convey spatial relationships and strengthen our understanding of geographic patterns and concepts.</li> <li>More than 300 specially chosen color photographs help communicate the personality of individual regions.</li> <li>Informative tables, graphs, and charts supplement textual material.</li> <li>Every chapter includes at least one boxed feature on a subject of special regional and topical significance, such as cultural diversity, gender and development, environmental issues, health and nutrition, migration, natural resource utilization, or distinctive regional features.</li> <li>Key terms are presented in boldface type within the text and at the end of each chapter; they are defined in a convenient glossary at the end of the book.</li> <li>Review and Geographer's Craft questions have been added at the end of each part to help students identify key issues and to enable them to understand how geography can contribute to the solution of development challenges.</li> <li>Each part ends with an updated list of further readings for students who wish to deepen and broaden their understanding of particular topics.</li> </ul> <p><b>New to This Edition</b></p> <p> The eighth edition of <i>World Regional Geography</i> represents a thorough revision. Every part of the book was examined carefully with the dual goals of keeping topics and data current and improving the clarity of the text and the graphics. </p> <p> The eighth edition features a continuing updating of all of the data, maps, and illustrative material. These changes are particularly evident in the cartography program, where the reader will note many new maps and a number of significant revisions to earlier maps. </p> <p> The eighth edition also marks the addition to the book of Merrill L. Johnson as coeditor and Bella Bychkova Jordan as coauthor of the Europe chapters. Both bring special gifts and strengths to the volume. </p></p><h2>Modern Physics for Scientists and Engineers, 3rd Edition</h2><p>In addition to featuring the latest discoveries, MODERN PHYSICS presents a contemporary and comprehensive approach to physics with a strong emphasis on applications. The authors discuss the experiments that led to key discoveries in order to illustrate the process behind scientific advances and to give students a historical perspective. The text features a flexible organization that allows instructors to select and teach topics in a preferred sequence without compromising the student&#39;s learning experience. A sound theoretical foundation in quantum theory is included to help physics majors succeed in their upper division courses.</p><p>Stephen Thornton is Professor of Physics at the University of Virginia.

Okay then, just add it twice!"), then fours ("... please just always double twice!") and eights ("... doubling three times works just great!") should be a cinch. Some of the rhymes are even as clever as Tang's tips: Over a panda pool game, he advises, "Nine is faster to compute if at first you overshoot. Here's a very clever tack, do 10 times and then subtract! What is 9 x 9? It's ten 9's minus 9.... What is 9 x 7? It's ten 7's minus 7."</p><p> Tang's text makes for a fun read-along, and illustrator Harry Briggs keeps things interesting with his computer-generated, animal-inspired spreads, with dancing chickens, ice-cream-flinging monkeys, and a fortunetelling cat. Kids won't feel left out of the action either: each section ends with a couple of challenges, and a key in the back spells out all the answers. (Ages 9 to 12) <i>--Paul Hughes</i></p>This upbeat picture book, presenting multiplication using numbers from zero through ten, is illustrated with often humorous pictures of animals engaged in activities such as fishing, painting, dancing. For every factor in the times table, Tang supplies a mnemonic rhyme, such as "Six is pretty quick to do, / just multiply by 3 then 2. / If this sounds like too much trouble, / triple first before you double!" and "Seven doesn't take much time, / even though it is a prime. / Here is all you have to do, / first times 5 then add times 2!" For the many people wondering if it isn't easier to memorize the times tables, Tang notes, "Instead, wouldn't it be great if by understanding math better you could learn to multiply numbers of any size, not just the ones you memorize?" Along the way, his playful juggling of numbers and the clearly laid out equations and visual explanations may help children learn to calculate more easily in their heads, see the patterns implied, and understand what they are doing when they multiply numbers. Encouraging rhymes and colorful, jaunty illustrations bolster the multiplication lesson.--Booklist, November 1st, 2002 <br><br>A multiplication book that really adds up. Snappy rhymes and problems to solve, going from 0 to 10, with one number per spread, offer valuable strategies that will help develop number sense. However, some terms, such as thrice and precise, might require a bit of clarification. "Prime" is mentioned in relation to the number seven but not defined and not necessary for the strategy given. Briggs's humorous cartoon illustrations in bold, flat colors add to the book's appeal. Overall, this title would enhance math units and would be a fun read-aloud.--School Library Journal, September 2002<br><br>The team behind The Grapes of Math and Math for All Seasons follows up with a third title for aspiring mathematicians: The Best of Times: Math Strategies That Multiply by Greg Tang, illus. by Harry Briggs. Tang eschews multiplication tables in favor of emphasizing a better understanding of numbers and quantities. Bouncy, rhyming ditties remind kids, among other things, that 0 times anything is zero ("For every problem it's the same,/ zilch or zero is its name!") Briggs's cheery signature artwork, featuring an active menagerie, keeps the concepts clear and the mood light.--Publishers Weekly, August 19th 2002<br><br>Tang would like to take the memorization out of the multiplication tables and insert some understanding. Play with the numbers, he suggests, get to know them and their relationships; use a little common sense. Here, critters of all stripes break the tables down into more digestible bits. Set in splashy, saturated color, zippy little quatrains introduce each table and explain his approach: "Two is very fast and fun, / quickly double and you're done. / What's that you say, be more precise? / Okay then, just add it twice." When the tack taken is straightforward and simple enough, it reveals the workings of multiplication, as when the fours tables are understood as doubled twice, or the fives tables as half of the tens. Sometimes, though, things can get a little unwieldy: "Seven doesn't take much time, / even though it is a prime. / Here is all you have to do, / first times 5 then add times 2." That's a lot to keep in your head, and memorization may seem less trouble. But Tang's hope is that through these math autopsies, readers will grasp the mechanics at work and bury their math anxieties.--Kirkus Reviews, July 15th 2002<br></p><h2>Perfect Phrases for Dealing with Difficult People: Hundreds of Ready-to-Use Phrases for Handling Conflict, Confrontations and Challenging Personalities</h2><p><p><b>Perfect Phrases for the Right Situation, Every Time</b></p> <p>Whether it's hiring employees or creating teams, the Perfect Phrases series has the tools for precise, effective communication in any situation.

The legend of the devil-beast that haunts the moors around the Baskerville family&#39;s home warns the descendants of that ancient clan never to venture out &#34;in those dark hours when the power of evil is exalted.&#34; Now, the most recent Baskerville, Sir Charles, is dead, and the footprints of a giant hound have been found near his body. Will the new heir meet the same fate?</p><p>We owe 1902's <i>The Hound of the Baskervilles</i> to Arthur Conan Doyle's good friend Fletcher "Bobbles" Robinson, who took him to visit some scary English moors and prehistoric ruins, and told him marvelous local legends about escaped prisoners and a 17th-century aristocrat who fell afoul of the family dog. Doyle transmogrified the legend: generations ago, a hound of hell tore out the throat of devilish Hugo Baskerville on the moonlit moor. Poor, accursed Baskerville Hall now has another mysterious death: that of Sir Charles Baskerville. Could the culprit somehow be mixed up with secretive servant Barrymore, history-obsessed Dr. Frankland, butterfly-chasing Stapleton, or Selden, the Notting Hill murderer at large? Someone's been signaling with candles from the mansion's windows. Nor can supernatural forces be ruled out. Can Dr. Watson--left alone by Sherlock Holmes to sleuth in fear for much of the novel--save the next Baskerville, Sir Henry, from the hound's fangs?<p> Many Holmes fans prefer Doyle's complete short stories, but their clockwork logic doesn't match the author's boast about this novel: it's "a real Creeper!" What distinguishes this particular <i>Hound</i> is its fulfillment of Doyle's great debt to Edgar Allan Poe--it's full of ancient woe, low moans, a Grimpen Mire that sucks ponies to Dostoyevskian deaths, and locals digging up Neolithic skulls without next-of-kins' consent. "The longer one stays here the more does the spirit of the moor sink into one's soul," Watson realizes. "Rank reeds and lush, slimy water-plants sent an odour of decay ... while a false step plunged us more than once thigh-deep into the dark, quivering mire, which shook for yards in soft undulations around our feet ... it was as if some malignant hand was tugging us down into those obscene depths." Read on--but, reader, watch your step! <i>--Tim Appelo</i></p>For generations the curse had hung over the Baskerville family. Now another life had been claimed by the mysterious and terrifying beast. Was it a demon or an animal lurking on the descolate moor? Would the new master of the Baskerville home be its next victim?<p></p><p>Sherlock Holmes and Watson set out to solve the most bewildering and bloodcurdling case of their careers in this world-famous classic of mystery and suspense.</p></p><h2>English Grammar for Students of German: The Study Guide for Those Learning German</h2><p>This book explains the grammatical terms that are encountered in the German textbook and shows the student how they relate to English grammar.

It is the variety of the representations of women--as gods, Madonnas, witches, and so on--that we hope to capture, in its permanence as well as its many transformations&#34;. Informed by the work of seventy-five distinguished historians, this five-volume series sets before us an engaging, panoramic chronicle that extends from antiquity to the present day. The inaugural volume brings women from the margins of ancient history into the fore. The authors&#39; deft analysis offers fresh insight into more than twenty centuries of Greek and Roman history and encompasses a landscape that stretches from the North Sea to the Mediterranean and from the Pillars of Hercules to the banks of the Indus. In the minds of the ancients, the roles for which women were destined were silent ones: motherhood and homemaking, tasks relegated to obscurity by scribes who focused exclusively on the deeds of men. Even the census neglected women; in Rome, only heiresses were counted. But the dearth of information about women in official archives and the near absence of writing by women from this era stand in stark contrast to the astonishing profusion of texts and images created by men that are concerned with women and gender. The number of women&#39;s representations is astonishing. The authors draw upon sources ranging from gravestones to floor plans, from stele inscriptions to papyrus rolls, from vase paintings to Greek and Roman literary works, to illustrate how representations of women evolved during thisage. They journey into the minds of men--from the Greeks imagining their goddesses to the Church Fathers inventing the figure of the martyred female saint--and bring to light an imaginative history of women and of the relations between the sexes. The authors explore select aspects of ancient mythology, philosophy, law, and art that illuminate the social position of women and the prevailing attitudes about sexual difference. The social practices that left an indelible mark on women&#39;s lives--practices associated with sexuality and reproduction, property, and religious ritual and priesthood--are fully examined in these pages. The myths of a remote era in which women held the reins of power are put to rest. What emerges is a vital portrait that enriches our understanding of the women of antiquity and enlarges our knowledge of their true roles in the social, religious, economic, and imaginative life of the ancient world. The volume&#39;s elegant prose and superb illustrations will engage and delight both the general reader and the seasoned historian.<p>Georges Duby, a member of the Acad�mie Fran�aise, is Professor of Medieval History at the Coll�ge de France.</p><p>Michelle Perrot is Professor of Contemporary History at the Universit� de Paris VII.</p></p><h2>Animal Talk: Interspecies Telepathic Communication</h2><p>Three decades ago, Penelope Smith fi rst presented <i>Animal Talk</i> and her effective telepathic communication techniques that can dramatically transform your relationships with your animal companions.

Christina Goering, a wealthy spinster in pursuit of sainthood ends up as a high-class call-girl, and Frieda Copperfield, abandons her dull husband for the love of a prostitute while travelling in Central America. The book is compelling and thought-provoking, and Bowles&#39;s original prose style makes it an experience to read.</p><p>Jane Bowles was born in New York in 1917. In 1938 she married the writer and composer Paul Bowles and travelled with him to Europe, Central America, Mexico and Ceylon, before settling in Tangier, Morocco in 1947. Two Serious Ladies was her most acclaimed work and it has been praised as innovative and powerful. Bowles also published the short story collection Plain Pleasures and a play In The Summer House which was performed on Broadway. Jane Bowles died in Malaga in 1973. Her work has been translated into many languages, securing her an international reputation.&#39;My favourite book.

Often misunderstood as a system of mind games, the Chan path involves a process of self-transformation grounded in carefully hewn spiritual disciplines and premises.<br> Master Sheng-yen provides an unprecedented understanding of Chan, its precepts, and its practice. Beginning with a basic overview of Buddhism and meditation, the book then details the progressive mental exercises traditionally followed by all Buddhists. Known as the Three Disciplines, these procedures develop moral purity, meditative concentration, and enlightening insight through the "stilling" of the mind. Master Sheng-yen then expounds Chan Buddhism, recounting its centuries-old history in China and illuminating its fundamental tenets. He contemplates the nature of Buddhahood, specifies the physical and mental prerequisites for beginning Chan practice, and humbly considers what it means to be an enlightened Chan master.<br></p><p><br><strong>Master Sheng-yen</strong> is an expatriate monk from mainland China who has been teaching in Taiwan and the United States for over two decades. He is the author of numerous popular and academic works, including <em>Subtle Wisdom: Understanding Suffering, Cultivating Compassion through Ch'an Buddhism</em> (1999) and <em>Complete Enlightenment: Translation and Commentary on the Sutra of Complete Enlightenment</em> (1997). He leads Dharma Drum Mountain, one of the three largest Buddhist organizations in Taiwan.<br>Master Sheng-yen, author of Subtle Wisdom and the head of monasteries in both Taiwan and the United States, has written another inspiring introduction to the Chan Buddhist tradition of China, more familiar to Americans as Zen, its incarnation in Japan. Eastern religion bookshelves these days are crowded with Zen primers and collections of sermons by eminent monks or nuns, but Sheng-yen's work stands out, bridging the two genres in a way that has been much needed. Buddhist sermons by Asian masters, when transplanted to American soil, can be misinterpreted by an audience lacking the cultural context for deeper understanding, leading to disillusionment with the institutional practice of Chan/Zen Buddhism. Sheng-yen, having taught in America for many years, is well aware of this and places Chan meditation in the larger Buddhist picture, showing its basis in history and morality. He explains the relationship between actual practice and the ideals expressed in sermons and in the paradoxical stories of early masters in such a way that a beginning student of Chan/Zen can then read the sermons with a deeper understanding of their relevance to his or her life. Aided by a masterful introduction by well-known scholar Dan Stevenson, this work brings introductory books on Chan/Zen to a new level of sophistication, accuracy and relevance to both the more advanced and the novice American practitioner.

This fluffy fellow is not part of traditional Sunday school discussions, yet every spring he makes an appearance in the forms of animated characters, marshmallow treats, and holiday stories. Harold Myra and Jane Kurisu, who have also addressed Christian vs. commercial messages during other holidays in <i>Santa: Are You for Real?</i> and <i>Halloween: Is It for Real?</i>, provide a way of talking about this confusing subject for young Christians.

Hyman Rickover made a unique impact on American and Navy culture. Dave Oliver is the first former nuclear submarine commander who sailed for the venerable admiral to write about Rickover's management techniques. Oliver draws upon a wealth of untold stories to show how one man changed American and Navy culture while altering the course of history.<br><p>The driving force behind America's nuclear submarine navy, Rickover revolutionized naval warfare while concurrently proving to be a wellspring of innovation that drove American technology in the latter half of the twentieth-century. As a testament to his success, Rickover's single-minded focus on safety protected both American citizens and sailors from nuclear contamination, a record that is in stark contrast to the dozens of nuclear reactor accidents suffered by the Russians.<br></p><p>While Rickover has been the subject of a number of biographies, little has been written about his unique management practices that changed the culture of a two-hundred-year-old institution and affected the outcome of the Cold War. Rickover's achievements have been obscured because they were largely conducted in secret and because he possessed a demanding and abrasive personality that alienated many potential supporters. Nevertheless he was an extraordinary manager with significant lessons for all those in decision-making positions.<br></p>The author had the good fortune to know and to serve under Rickover during much of his thirty-year career in the Navy and is singularly qualified to demonstrate the management and leadership principles behind Rickover's success.<p></p></p><p>Rear Admiral Dave Oliver, USN (Ret.) is a 1963 graduate of the U.S. Naval Academy who spent thirty-two years in the Navy, served at sea on board both diesel-electric and nuclear submarines, commanded a nuclear submarine, and served as chief of staff of the Seventh Fleet. His final military tour was as principal deputy to the civilian Navy acquisition executive. During the Clinton administration he was Principal Deputy Undersecretary of Defense for Acquisition, Technology and Logistics and in the Bush administration he was the director of management and budget for the Coalition Forces in Iraq. After leaving the Navy he was the CEO of the EADS, North America Defense Company as well as an executive at Northrop Grumman and Westinghouse. He now lives in Northern Virginia."To its credit, this book touches on and invites thought and discussion about more than a few attributes of senior leadership, including personal accountability. Rickover was quick to dismiss subordinates who he felt had failed his program--yet the degree to which he would be willing to sacrifice his own position and power is less clear, particularly when even many of his supporters feel the admiral clung to power too long and eventually became a detriment to the program he had created. Another area involves personal and professional ethics. Oliver seems to make the point that when the stakes are high enough, the ends do justify the means and a successful outcome justifies questionable or even illegal actions. This invites a subsequent discussion involving the deepest questions of what it is to be an officer and member of the profession of arms."<b><i>--Naval War College Review</i></b><br><br>"Oliver mixes tales of the often-eccentric Rickover with genuine admiration for his leadership abilities, especially in the face of many adversities, such as the fabrication of Nautilus, building and maintaining the nuclear fleet during the Cold and Vietnam Wars, and his conflicts with high profile officers such as Admiral Elmo Zumwalt. Along the way, Oliver relates stories from his own naval career; examples of how he applied Rickover's managerial principles. In summary, <i>Against the Tide,</i> illuminating on many levels, is a reasoned path toward understanding what made the complex Hyman Rickover such a special naval officer."<b><i>--The Northern Mariner</i></b><br><br>"Oliver uses successive chapters of this book to describe different aspects of Rickover's leadership style. To this end, his own experiences in senior business management after leaving the Navy lend credence to the topics he selects to discuss. At the end of each section he asks the reader various questions which might prompt them to apply Rickover's theories to their own workplace. Thus, Oliver shows how Rickover was quite ruthless with potential COs: if there were doubts about their abilities to shoulder the burden of responsibility they would be sacked. His nuclear captains had to demonstrate that they were aware of the need for continual improvement. He actively encouraged innovation and often preferred eager and thrusting young minds rather than experienced veterans. From a broader perspective, Rickover wanted the men who commanded these nuclear boats not only to accept the great responsibilities they held but also to be aware of the higher purposes they served."<b><i>--Warship 2016</i></b><br><br>"Oliver draws upon a wealth of untold stories to show how one man changed American and Navy culture while altering the course of history. The author had the good fortune to know and to serve under Rickover during much of his thirty-year career in the Navy and is singularly qualified to demonstrate the management and leadership principles behind Rickover's success."<b><i>--Ocean News &amp; Technology</i></b><br><br>"The author, a submariner, is well positioned to convey the leadership principles of the father of the nuclear Navy, RADM Hyman Rickover, who ran the Navy's nuclear-propulsion program long after his peers retired. As the driving force who brought nuclear power to fruition and revolutionized the Navy, Rickover's personality and leadership fostered a culture of unrelenting standards and attention to safety that have resulted in a submarine force and nuclear-powered ships with a safety and operational record second to none. Rarely has one individual exerted such an influence on the course of the Navy."<b><i>--Seapower</i></b><br><br><i>"Against the Tide</i> is a highly enjoyable read. Admiral Dave Oliver uses crisp language, personal anecdotes and provocative questions to put forward the leadership principles of Admiral Rickover, the father of the USA's nuclear navy. With just 137 pages <i>Against the Tide</i> does not take long to read but it is packed full of useful material. The author's professional development and life experiences provide excellent case studies for Rickover's leadership principles. His anecdotes are candid, forthright and memorable. <i>Against the Tide</i> is highly recommended for anyone wishing to better understand our modern era of continuous cultural evolution and is looking for alternatives."<b>--Australian Naval Institute</b><br><br>"Exceptionally well written and informative, <i>Against the Tide</i> is a compelling and rewarding read that is both thoughtful and though provoking."<b><i>--The Midwest Book Review</i></b><br><br>"From its highly appropriate title to its usefully extensive bibliography and first rate index, this comparatively small book is a great and valuable history. A personal but excellent and important biography."<b><i>--Ausmarine Magazine</i></b><br><br><p></p>"Oliver has written an entertaining, slim volume that is a series of anecdotes and stories tied to leadership and management principles gleaned from years of observing and studying 'the father of the nuclear navy.'"<b>--CIMSEC.org</b><br><br><p></p>"...anyone seeking to understand how the U.S. Navy submarine force came to embody the apparently contradictory qualities of strict engineering discipline and breathtaking operational audacity would do well to read David Oliver's enjoyable <i>Against the Tide."<b>--The Journal of Military History</b></i><p></p></p><h2>The Undertaking of Lily Chen</h2><p><p>In <i>The Undertaking of Lily Chen</i>, Deshi, a hapless young man living in northern China, is suddenly expelled from ordinary life when his brother dies in an accident.

The author claims that these disciplines can infuse life with joy, promoting inner peace and fulfilment. Richard Foster, an &#34;evangelical&#34; Quaker, founded and chairs the Milton Center which is designed to help Christian writers achieve exellence in their work. He won the 1978 Writer of the Year (US) Award for &#34;Celebration of Discipline&#34;, and the Gold Medallion Award in 1982 for &#34;Freedom of Simplicity&#34; and he also wrote &#34;Money, Sex and Power&#34;</p><p>When Richard Foster began writing <i>Celebration of Discipline</i> more than 20 years ago, an older writer gave him a bit of advice: "Be sure that every chapter forces the reader into the next chapter." Foster took the advice to heart; as a result, his book presents one of the most compelling and readable visions of Christian spirituality published in the past few decades. After beginning with a simple observation--"Superficiality is the curse of our age.... The desperate need today is not for a greater number of intelligent people, or gifted people, but for deep people"--Foster's book moves to explain the disciplines people must cultivate in order to achieve spiritual depth. In succinct, urgent, and sometimes humorous chapters, Foster defines a broad range of classic spiritual disciplines in terms that are lucid without being too limiting and offers advice that's practical without being overly prescriptive. For instance, after describing meditation as a combination of "intense intimacy and awful reverence," he settles into such down-to-earth topics as how to choose a place and a posture in which to meditate. <p> Perhaps most interesting and useful is Foster's chapter on the controversial Christian discipline of submission. According to Foster, submission does not demand self-hatred or loss of identity. Instead, it simply means growing secure in the conviction that "our happiness is not dependent on getting what we want" but on the fulfillment that naturally flows from love of one's neighbors. Such wise and encouraging suggestions have helped many readers to discard the idea that discipline is an onerous duty and to move toward a liberating and simpler idea of discipline--whose defining character, as Foster never forgets, is joy. <i>--Michael Joseph Gross</i></p>In the twenty years since its publication, <i>Celebration of Discipline</i> has helped over a million seekers discover a richer spiritual life infused with joy, peace, and a deeper understanding of God. For this special twentieth-anniversary edition, Richard J. Foster has added an introduction, in which he shares the story of how this beloved and enduring spiritual guidebook came to be. <p>Hailed by many as the best modern book on Christian spirituality, <i>Celebration of Discipline<i></i> explores the "classic Disciplines," or central spiritual practices, of the Christian faith. Along the way, Foster shows that it is only by and through these practices that the true path to spiritual growth can be found. </i></p><p><i>Dividing the Disciplines into three movements of the Spirit, Foster shows how each of these areas contribute to a balanced spiritual life. The inward Disciplines of meditation, prayer, fasting, and study offer avenues of personal examination and change. The outward Disciplines of simplicity, solitude, submission, and service help prepare us to make the world a better place. The corporate Disciplines of confession, worship, guidance, and celebration bring us nearer to one another and to God. </i></p><p><i>Foster provides a wealth of examples demonstrating how these Disciplines can become part of our daily activities--and how they can help us shed our superficial habits and "bring the abundance of God into our lives." He offers crucial new insights on simplicity, demonstrating how the biblical view of simplicity, properly understood and applied, brings joy and balance to our inward and outward lives and "sets us free to enjoy the provision of God as a gift that can be shared with others." The discussion of celebration, often the most neglected of the Disciplines, shows its critical importance, for it stands at the heart of the way to Christ. <i>Celebration of Discipline</i> will help Christians everywhere to embark on a journey of prayer and spiritual growth.</i></p></p><h2>The Last Samurai</h2><p>This novel is the basis of the motion picture by the same title.</p><p>Helen DeWitt's extraordinary debut, <i>The Last Samurai</i>, centers on the relationship between Sibylla, a single mother of precocious and rigorous intelligence, and her son, who, owing to his mother's singular attitude to education, develops into a prodigy of learning. Ludo reads Homer in the original Greek at 4 before moving on to Hebrew, Japanese, Old Norse, and Inuit; studying advanced mathematical techniques (Fourier analysis and Laplace transformations); and, as the title hints, endlessly watching and analyzing Akira Kurosawa's masterpiece, <i>The Seven Samurai</i>. But the one question that eludes an answer is that of the name of his father: Sibylla believes the film obliquely provides the male role models that Ludo's genetic father cannot, and refuses to be drawn on the question of paternal identity. The child thinks differently, however, and eventually sets out on a search, one that leads him beyond the certainties of acquired knowledge into the complex and messy world of adults.<p> The novel draws on themes topical and perennial--the hothousing of children, the familiar literary trope of the quest for the (absent) father--and as such, divides itself into two halves: the first describes Ludo's education, the second follows him in his search for his father and father figures. The first stresses a sacred, Apollonian pursuit of logic, precise (if wayward) erudition, and the erratic and endlessly fascinating architecture of languages, while the second moves this knowledge into the world of emotion, human ambitions, and their attendant frustrations and failures. </p><p> <i>The Last Samurai</i> is about the pleasure of ideas, the rich varieties of human thought, the possibilities that life offers us, and, ultimately, the balance between the structures we make of the world and the chaos that it proffers in return. Stylistically, the novel mirrors this ambivalence: DeWitt's remarkable prose follows the shifts and breaks of human consciousness and memory, capturing the intrusions of unspoken thought that punctuate conversation while providing tantalizing disquisitions on, for example, Japanese grammar or the physics of aerodynamics. It is remarkable, profound, and often very funny.

The young man is the son of a doctor and former politician, a man of an impeccable integrity all too rare in Italian politics. Dr. Moro is clearly and understandably devastated by his son&#39;s death; but neither appears at all keen to talk to the police nor involve Brunetti in any investigation of the circumstances in which he died. As Brunetti - and the indispensable Signorina Elettra - investigate further they are faced by a wall of silence, as the military protects its own and civilians are unwilling to talk. Is this the natural reluctance of Italians to involve themselves with the authorities, or is Brunetti facing a conspiracy of silence?</p><p>Donna Leon was named by The Times as one of the 50 Greatest Crime Writers. She is an award-winning crime novelist, celebrated for the bestselling Brunetti series. Donna has lived in Venice for thirty years and previously lived in Switzerland, Saudi Arabia, Iran and China, where she worked as a teacher. Donna&#39;s books have been translated into 35 languages and have been published around the world. Her previous novels featuring Commissario Brunetti have all been highly acclaimed; including Friends in High Places, which won the CWA Macallan Silver Dagger for Fiction, Fatal Remedies, Doctored Evidence, A Sea of Troubles and Beastly Things.<p>Brunetti arrived before the children did, so he opted to keep Paola company while she finished preparing the meal. As she set the table, he lifted pot lids and opened the oven, comforted to find nothing but familiar dishes: lentil soup, chicken smothered in red cabbage, and what looked like radicchio di Treviso.</p> <p>"Are you bringing all of your detective skills to bear in examining that chicken?" Paola asked as she set glasses on the table.</p> <p>"No, not really," he said, closing the oven and standing upright. "My investigation has to do with the radicchio, Signora, and whether there are perhaps traces in it of the same pancetta I detected in the lentil soup."</p> <p>"A nose as good as that," she said, coming over and placing the tip of her finger on it, "could effectively put an end to crime in this city." "I went to see Signora Moro," he began, pausing to see if Paola would react. She did not, so he went on, "I wanted to talk to her about the hunting accident."</p> <p>"And?" Paola prodded.</p> <p>"Someone shot at her from the woods near her friends' house, but then some other hunters came along and took her to the hospital."</p> <p>"Are you sure they were other hunters?" Paola asked, giving evidence that her native skepticism had been enhanced by more than two decades of marriage to a policeman.</p> <p>"It would seem so," he said, leaving it at that.</p> <p>Knowing how reluctant he would be to mention him, Paola asked, "And the boy?"</p> <p>"She said that he didn't kill himself, and that's all she said."</p> <p>"She's his mother," Paola said.

Make that <em>was.</em> A scandal has brought him home to Blue River, Texas, a place where a man can slow down, take stock and plan his next move. Which <em>doesn't</em> include staying at the family ranch with his brothers. A city boy, Garrett doesn't think he has the land in his blood.<br><br>But Blue River has other attractions, like his former high school nemesis, Julie Remington. Now a striking woman, Julie comes complete with a four-year-old cowboy, a three-legged beagle and deep ties to the community. Good thing they have nothing in common...except their undeniable attraction and a future brighter than the Texas sun.<br><br></p><p><b>Linda LaelMiller</b> is a #1&nbsp;<i>New YorkTimes</i>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<i>USA TODAY </i>bestselling author of morethan&nbsp;one hundred&nbsp; novels. Long passionate about the Civil War buff, she has studied theera avidly and has&nbsp;made many visits to Gettysburg,&nbsp; where she has witnessedreenactments of the legendary clash between North and South. Linda exploresthat turbulent time in <i>The Yankee Widow.</i><br><br>Garrett McKettrick wanted a horse under him&#x2014;a fleet cow-pony like the ones bred to work the herds on the Silver Spur Ranch. But for now, anyway, the Porsche would have to do.<br><br>Because of the hour&#x2014;it was a little after 3:00 a.m.&#x2014;Garrett had that particular stretch of Texas highway all to himself. The moon and stars cast silvery shadows through the open sunroof and shimmered on the rolled-up sleeves of his white dress shirt, while a country oldie, with lots of twang, pounded from the sound system. Everything in him&#x2014;from the nuclei of his cells outward&#x2014;vibrated to the beat.<br><br>He'd left the tuxedo jacket, the cummerbund, the tie, the fancy cuff links, back in Austin&#x2014;right along with one or two of his most cherished illusions.<br><br>The party was definitely over&#x2014;for him, anyhow.<br><br>He should have seen it coming&#x2014;or at least listened to people who <em>did </em>see it coming, specifically his brothers, Tate and Austin. They'd done their best to warn him.<br><br>Senator Morgan Cox, they'd said, in so many words and in their different ways, wasn't what he seemed.<br><br>Against his will, Garrett's mind looped back a few hours, and even as he sped along that straight, dark ribbon of road, another part of him relived the shock in excruciating detail.<br><br>Cox had always presented himself as a family man, in public and private. A corner of each of his hand-carved antique desks in both the Austin and Washington offices supported a small forest of framed photos&#x2014;himself and Nan on their wedding day, himself and Nan and the first crop of kids, himself and Nan and <em>more </em>kids, some of whom were adopted and had special needs. Altogether, there were nine Cox offspring.<br><br>The dogs&#x2014;several generations of golden retrievers, all rescued, of course&#x2014;were pictured as well.<br><br>That night, with no warning at all, Garrett's longtime boss and mentor had arrived at an important fundraiser, held in a glittering hotel ballroom, but not with Nan on his arm&#x2014;elegant, articulate, wholesome Nan, with her own pedigree as a former Texas governor's daughter. Oh, no. This powerful U.S. senator, a war hero, a man with what many people considered a straight shot at the White House, had instead escorted a classic bimbo, later identified as a twenty-two-year-old pole dancer who went by the unlikely name of Mandy Chante.<br><br>Before God, his amazed supporters, the press and, worst of all, Nan, the senator proceeded to announce that he and Mandy were soul mates. Kindred spirits. They'd been lovers in a dozen other lifetimes, he rhapsodized. In short, Cox explained from the microphone on the dais&#x2014;his lover hovering earnestly beside him in a long, form-fitting dress rippling with ice-blue sequins, which gave her the look of a mermaid with feet&#x2014;he hoped everyone would understand.<br><br>He had to follow his heart.<br><br>If only the senator's <em>heart </em>were the organ he was following, Garrett lamented silently.<br><br>One of those freeze-frame silences followed, vast and uncomfortable, turning the whole assembly into a garden of stone statues while several hundred people tried to process what they'd just heard Cox say.<br><br>Who <em>was </em>this guy, they were probably asking themselves, and what had he done with the Morgan Cox they all knew? Where, Garrett himself wondered, was the man who had given that stirring eulogy at the double funeral after Jim and Sally McKettrick, his folks, were killed a decade before?<br><br>The mass paralysis following Morgan's proclamation lasted only a few seconds, and Garrett was quick to shake it off. Automatically, he scanned the room for Nan Cox&#x2014;his late mother's college roommate&#x2014;and found her standing near the grand piano, alone.<br><br>Most likely, Nan, a veteran political wife, had been in transit between one conversational cluster and another when her husband dropped the bombshell. She was still smiling, in fact, and the effect was eerie, even surreal.<br><br>Like the true lady she was, however, Nan immediately drew herself up, made her way through friends and strangers, enemies and intimate confidants to step up to Garrett's side, link her arm with his and whisper, "Get him out of here, Garrett. Get Morgan out of here <em>now, </em>before this gets any worse."<br><br>Garrett glanced at the senator, who ignored his wife of more than three decades, the mother of his children, the flesh-and-blood, hurting woman he had just humiliated in a very public way, to gaze lovingly into the upturned face of his mistress. The mermaid's plump, glistening lower lip jutted out in a pout.<br><br>Cox patted the young woman's hand reassuringly then, acting as though <em>she, </em>not Nan, might have been traumatized.<br><br>The cameras came out, amateur and professional; a blinding dazzle surrounded the happy couple. Within a couple of minutes, some of that attention would surely shift to Nan.<br><br>"I'm getting <em>you </em>away first," Garrett told Nan, using his right arm to lock her against his side and starting for the nearest way out. As the senator's aide, Garrett had a lot of experience at running interference, and he always scoped out every exit in every venue in advance, just in case. Even the familiar ones, like that hotel, which happened to be the senator's favorite.<br><br>Nan didn't argue&#x2014;not then, anyway. She kept up with Garrett, offered no protest when he hustled her through a corridor crowded with carts and wait-staff, then into a service elevator.<br><br>Garrett flipped open his cell phone and speed-dialed a number as they descended, Nan leaning against the elevator wall now, looking down at her feet, stricken to silence. Her beautifully coiffed silver hair gleamed in the fluorescent light.<br><br>The senator's personal driver, Troy, answered on the first ring, his tone cheerful. "Garrett? What's up, man?"<br><br>"Bring the car around to the back of the hotel," Garrett said. "And hurry."<br><br>Nan looked up, met Garrett's gaze. She was pale, and her eyes looked haunted, but the smile resting on her mouth was real, if slight. "You're probably scaring poor Troy to death," she scolded, putting a hand out for the cell phone.<br><br>Garrett handed it over just as they reached the ground floor, and Nan spoke efficiently into the mouthpiece.<br><br>"Troy? This is Mrs. Cox. Just so you know, there's no fire, and nobody's been shot or had a heart attack. But it probably <em>is </em>a good idea for me to leave the building, so be a dear and pick me up behind the hotel." A pause. "Oh, you are? Perfect. I'll explain in the car. Meanwhile, here's Garrett again."<br><br>With that, she handed the phone back to Garrett.<br><br>When he put it to his ear, he heard Troy suck in a nervous breath. "I'm outside the kitchen door, buddy," he said. "I'll take Mrs. Cox home and come straight back, in case you need some help."<br><br>"Excellent idea," Garrett said, as the elevator doors opened into the institution-sized kitchen.<br><br>The senator's wife smiled and nodded to a bevy of surprised kitchen workers as she and Garrett headed for the outside door.<br><br>True to his word, Troy was waiting in back, the rear passenger-side door of the sedan already open for Mrs. Cox.<br><br>He and Garrett exchanged glances as Nan slipped into the back seat, but neither of them spoke.<br><br>Troy closed her door, but she immediately lowered the window.<br><br>"My husband needs your help," she told Garrett quietly but firmly. "This is no time to judge him&#x2014;there will be enough of that in the media."<br><br>"Yes, ma'am," Garrett answered.<br><br>Troy climbed behind the wheel again, and Garrett was already heading back through the kitchen door when they pulled away.<br><br>He strode to the service elevator, pushed the button and waited until it lumbered down from some upper floor.<br><br>When the doors slid open, there were the senator and the bimbo.<br><br>The senator blinked when he saw Garrett. He looked older somehow, and he was wearing his glasses. <em>"There</em> you are," he said. "I was wondering where you'd gotten to, young McKettrick. Nan, too. Have you seen my wife?"<br><br>Nan's remark, spoken only a minute or two before, echoed in Garrett's mind.<br><br><em>My husband needs your help.</em><br><br>And juxtaposed to that, the senator's oddly solicitous, <em>Have you seen my wife?</em><br><br>Garrett made an attempt at a smile, but it felt like a grimace instead. He narrowed his eyes slightly, shot a glance at the mermaid and then faced the senator again. "Mrs. Cox is on her way home, sir," he said.<br><br>"I imagine she was upset," Cox replied, looking both regretful and detached.<br><br>"She's a lady, sir," Garrett answered evenly. "And she's behaving like one."<br><br>Cox gave a fond chuckle and nodded. "First, last and always, Nan is a lady," he agreed.<br><br>Beside him, the mermaid seethed, clinging a little more tightly to the senator's arm and glaring at Garrett.<br><br>Garrett glared right back. This woman, he decided, was no mermaid, and no lady, either. She was a barracuda.<br><br>"It would seem I haven't chosen the best time to break our news to the world, my dear," the senator said, patting his beloved's bejeweled and manicured hand in the same devoted way he'd done upstairs. "I probably should have told Nan in private."<br><br><em>Ya think? </em>Garrett asked silently.<br><br>"You work for Senator Cox," said the barracuda, turning to Garrett, <em>"not </em>his wife. Why did you just go off and leave us&#x2014;him&#x2014;<em>stranded </em>like that? The reporters&#x2014;"<br><br>Garrett folded his arms and waited.<br><br>"It was awful!" blurted the barracuda.<br><br>What had the woman expected? Champagne all around? Congratulatory kisses and handshakes? A romantic waltz with the senator while the orchestra played "Moon River"?<br><br>"Luckily," the senator told Garrett affably, as though there had been no outburst from the sequined contingent, "I remembered how often you and I had discussed security measures, and Mandy and I were able to slip away and find the nearest service elevator."<br><br>The corridor seemed to be closing in on Garrett. He undid his string tie and opened the top three buttons of his shirt. "Mandy?" he asked.<br><br>The senator laughed warmly. "Mandy Chante," he said, "meet Garrett McKettrick, my right-hand man."<br><br>"Mandy Chante," Garrett repeated, with no inflection at all.<br><br>Mandy's eyes blazed. "What are we supposed to do now?" she demanded.<br><br>"I guess that depends on the senator's wishes," Garrett said mildly. "Will you be going home to the ranch tonight, sir, or staying in town?"<br><br><em>Or maybe I could just drop you off at the nearest E.R. for psychiatric evaluation.</em><br><br>"I'm sure Nan will be at the condo," the senator mused. "Our showing up there could be awkward."<br><br><em>Awkward. Yes, indeed, Senator, that would be awkward.</em><br><br>Garrett cleared his throat. "Could I speak to you alone for a moment, sir?" he asked.<br><br>Mandy, with one arm already resting in the crook of the senator's elbow, intertwined the fingers of both hands to get a double grip. "Pooky and I have no secrets from each other," she said.<br><br><em>Pooky?</em><br><br>Garrett's stomach did a slow roll.<br><br>"Now, now, dear," Cox told Mandy, gently freeing himself fromher physical hold, at least. "Garrett means well, and you mustn't feel threatened." Addressing Garrett next, the older man added, "This is not a good time for a discussion. I'd rather not leave Mandy standing alone in this corridor."<br><br>"Sir&#x2014;"<br><br>"Tomorrow, Garrett," the senator said. "You and I will discuss this tomorrow, in my office."<br><br>Garrett merely nodded, clamping his back teeth together.<br><br>"It's weird down here," Mandy complained, looking around. "Weird and spooky. Couldn't we get a suite or something?"<br><br>"That's a fine idea," Cox replied ebulliently. There was more hand-patting, and then the senator turned to face Garrett again. "You'll take care of that for us, won't you, Garrett? Book a suite upstairs, I mean? Under your own name, of course, and not mine."<br><br>"Sure," Garrett answered wearily, thinking of Nan and the many kids and the faithful golden retrievers. Pointing out to his employer that nobody would be fooled by the suite-booking gambit would probably be futile.<br><br>"Good," the senator said, satisfied.<br><br>"Do we have to wait here while he gets us a room, Pooky?" Mandy whined. "I don't like this place. It's like a cellar or something."<br><br>Cox smiled at her, and his tone was soothing. "The press will be watching the lobby for us," he said reasonably. "And we won't have to wait long, because Garrett will be quick. Won't you, Garrett?"<br><br>Bile scalded the back of Garrett's throat. "I'll be quick," he answered.<br><br>That was when he started wanting the horse under him. He wanted to hear hooves pounding over hard ground and breathe the clean, uncomplicated air of home.<br><br>Duty first.<br><br>He went upstairs, arranged for comfortable quarters at the reception desk, and called the senator's personal cell phone when he had a room number to give him.<br><br>"Here's Troy, back again," the senator said on the other end of the call, sounding pleased. "I'm sure he wouldn't mind escorting us up there. If you'd just get us some ice before you leave, Garrett&#x2014;"<br><br>Garrett closed his eyes, refrained from pointing out that he wasn't a bellman, or a room service waiter. "Yes, sir," he said.<br><br>Fifteen minutes later, he and Troy descended together, in yet another service elevator. For a black man, Troy looked pale.<br><br>"Is he <em>serious?" </em>Troy asked.<br><br>Garrett sighed deeply, looking up and watching the digital numbers over the doors as they plunged. His tie was dangling; he tugged it loose from his shirt collar and stuffed it into the pocket of his tuxedo jacket. "It would seem so," he said.<br><br>"Mrs. Cox says the senator is having a mental breakdown, and we all have to stick by him," Troy said glumly, shaking his head. "She's sure he'll come to his senses and everything will be fine."<br><br>"Right," Garrett said, grimly distracted. He'd sprint around to the side parking lot once he and Troy were outside, climb into his Porsche, and head for home. In two hours, he could be back on the Silver Spur.<br><br>They were standing in the alley again when Troy asked, "Why do I get the feeling that this comes as a surprise to you?"<br><br>The question threw Garrett, at least momentarily, and he didn't answer.<br><br>Troy thumbed the fob on his key ring, and the sedan started up. "Get in, and I'll give you a lift to your car," he told Garrett, with a sigh.<br><br>Garrett got into the sedan. "You knew about Mandy and the senator?" he asked.<br><br>Troy shook his head again and gave a raspy chuckle. "Hell, Garrett," he said, "I drive the man's car. He's been seeing her for months."<br><br>Garrett closed his eyes. Tate had accused him once of having his head up his ass, as far as the senator's true nature was concerned. And he'd defended Morgan Cox, been ready to fight his own brother to defend the bastard's honor.<br><br>"What about Nan? Did she know, too?" Remembering the expression on her face earlier, in the ballroom, Garrett didn't think so.<br><br>"Maybe," Troy said. "She didn't hear it from me, though."<br><br>He drew the sedan to a stop behind Garrett's Porsche. News vans were pulling out on the other end of the lot, along with a stream of ordinary cars.<br><br>Film clips and sound bites were probably already running on the local channels.<br><br>Turn out the lights, Garrett thought dismally. The party's over.<br><br>The senator not only wouldn't be getting the presidential nomination, he'd be lucky if he wasn't forced to resign before he'd finished his current term in office.<br><br>All of which left Garrett himself up Shit's Creek, without a paddle.<br><br>He got out of the sedan and said goodnight to Troy.<br><br></p><h2>The Mass: Four Encounters with Jesus That Will Change Your Life</h2><p>For the first time, the popular message that continues to inspire tens of thousands of Catholics nationwide is available in print.

He is currently a Fellow of Gresham College in London and Adjunct Professor of Religion at North Carolina State University. His books include The Meanings of Death, the Oxford Dictionary of World Religions, and DK&#39;s God: A Brief History.Bowker (divinity, Gresham Coll., London) has produced two very different books, though both are focused on world religion. The Oxford Dictionary, whose entries often lack information on etymology and pronunciation, is actually a one-volume desktop encyclopedia for ready reference. Combining brevity of exposition with a massive number of entries in an attempt to be dictionary-like, the work suffers from trying to be comprehensive in breadth of coverage instead of depth. The psychology of religion is discussed in a half-page, for instance, and the Church Fathers get only two sentences. In addition, the entries are uneven in quality; one has the feeling that the 80 contributors are each writing according to his or her own personal interests and styles. Despite these idiosyncracies, the work is a solid reference source for people who want to know only the barest of facts about any religious topic. In World Religions, on the other hand, one has the feeling that Bowker, now the author, is finally freed to range over what he wants to say and how he wants to say it. This book is a bold attempt to meld religious information with expressive art and to use the art as a tool for pedagogy. Each religion is represented by a few brilliantly illustrated icons, paintings, or sculptures, which the author painstakingly annotates to illuminate their theologies and deepen one's insight. Whether he is using Michelangelo's Final Judgment to explain Christian eschatology or a handscroll of Chou Ch'en to explain Taoist concepts of immortality, the emphasis upon the visual makes these religions vibrant and intriguing. There are surprising discrepancies between the two works. World Religions has generous discussions of the ancient Egyptian, Greek, Roman, Norse, and Celtic religions, topics not even included in the Oxford Dictionary. There are also variations of names. Ultimately, World Religions is the more commendable publication, though both books are recommended for most libraries.?Glenn Masuchika, Chaminade Univ.

Now aided by her mercurial, mysterious father, Nicholas, and a brave band of heroes, she fights to recover the magical city of Lodun and the chance for hope. But the enemy is relentless, and amid turmoil and danger, only the discovery of a secret portal holds any hope of saving what is left of Ile-Rien. But the ancient portal leads to a mysterious ruin hidden behind the awesome Gate of Gods&#x2014;a realm of wonder and danger beyond any they have ever imagined ...</p></p><p><p>Martha Wells is the author of five previous novels: <em>The Wizard Hunters,</em> the first book of the Fall of Ile-Rien, <em>The Element of Fire, City of Bones, Wheel of the Infinite,</em> and <em>The Death of the Necromancer,</em> which was nominated for the Nebula Award. She lives in College Station, Texas, with her husband.</p>Two books ago, in <i>The Wizard Hunters</i> (2003), Wells showed Ile-Rien about to fall to the mysterious, unstoppable Gardier, who attack from black airships; thanks to a sphere created by sorcerer Nicholas Valiarde, his daughter Tremaine and a ship's crew of defenders are thrown into a world more primitive than Ile-Rien. In <i>The Ships of Air</i> (2004), the Gardier, revealed as hailing from yet another world, are revealed to be using magic they don't completely understand, and Ile-Rien's defenders learn enough to defeat the Gardier. Now, in <i>The Gate of Gods</i>, Tremaine Valiarde and her comrades have found a hidden Gardier base and hints of what may stop them, though it calls for jumping near blindly through more sorcerous gates, and Ile-Rien is running out of time. Wells shows us some very convincing characters in a desperate situation: attacked without warning, their usual weapons made ineffective, and with allies sometimes as strange as their enemies. The plot is very complex, so start the trilogy at the beginning. <i>Frieda Murray</i><br><i>Copyright � American Library Association.

In 1968, at age eleven, Mary Bell was tried and convicted of murdering two small boys in Newcastle upon Tyne, England. Gitta Sereny, who covered the sensational trial, never believed the characterization of Bell as the incarnation of evil, the bad seed personified. If we are ever to understand the pressures that lead children to commit serious crimes, Sereny felt, only those children, as adults, can enlighten us. <br><br>Twenty-seven years after her conviction, Mary Bell agreed to talk to Sereny about her harrowing childhood, her terrible acts, her public trial, and her years of imprisonment-to talk about what was done to her and what she did, who she was and who she became. Nothing Bell says is intended as an excuse for her crimes. But her devastating story forces us to ponder society's responsibility for children at the breaking point, whether in Newcastle, Arkansas, or Oregon. <br><br>A masterpiece of wisdom and sympathy, Gitta Sereny's wrenching portrait of a girl's damaged childhood and a woman's fight for moral regeneration urgently calls on us to hear the cries of all children at risk.<br></p><p>In 1968, cases like that of Mary Bell were almost unheard of. Two little boys were dead, and the two accused killers, Mary Bell and Norma Bell (no relation), were 11 and 13. Norma was acquitted, but Mary was found guilty and sentenced to life in prison. Almost 30 years after her conviction, Mary Bell was able to tell her story, from her troubled childhood to her eventual release from prison as an institutionalized young woman and her awkward attempts to build a life for herself in a hostile world. <p> In <i>Cries Unheard</i>, Gitta Sereny coaxes out Mary's story without becoming an apologist. She is blunt about the brutality of these crimes, and doesn't attempt to dismiss them as the acts of an ignorant child. When Bell gives explanations that don't ring true, Sereny pushes on, refusing to accept the easy answers. The questions raised are wrenching: Can children understand the finality of death? Are they capable of evil? Did Mary Bell understand what was happening to her in the courtroom where she was declared a "bad seed," a child so innately evil that she would have to be locked away for the rest of her life? Was she responsible for her actions at all, or were those responsible for her to blame? While <i>Cries Unheard</i> can't answer all these questions, it dissects Bell's unthinkable acts to the point that we can almost understand them. <i>--Lisa Higgins</i></p>Gitta Sereny is our foremost writer on questions of crime and conscience. Her previous books include Into That Darkness: An Examination of Conscience and Albert Speer: His Battle with Truth.

If that term seemed to apply to their rapid advance during the first weeks after the Riviera landings, it quickly lost meaning when the German Nineteenth fortified the Vosges Mountains for one of the hardest-fought battles of the European Theater. This well told history recounts that largely unknown struggle, concentrating on two "lost battalions", one German, the other the 141st "Alamo Regiment" of the 36th (Texas) Division, which was rescued by the heroic 442nd RCT, which was composed of Japanese-Americans and was the most-decorated unit of the U.S. Army. Based on many interviews, and with photos, maps, and appendices, this is a worthwhile addition to the scarce literature of the Vosges Campaign. --A Customer<br><br>Throughout the last fifty years since the end of World War II there have been many accounts of the many battles fought and the people who fought them. There is one group which is almost always left out. The 442nd RCT. This group of Americans fought some of the bloodiest battles in the war. This book truly places the stellar record of the men of the 442nd in the history books. I gives me a new found respect for these men and the job that they did through what must have been tremendous pressure to succeed. Some of these men I know personally and have the utmost respect for the job that they did. It makes me proud to be an American. This book really does them justice in a time of great injustice. This is one to pass down to the next generation. --Dean T. Ochi<br><br>Having been one of the men rescued, there is no way we can thank the men of 442 for their heroic efforts. The American press ignored the fact that they were Japanese- Americans. Unfortunately, it is only of late we became aware of the casualties, killed and wounded, suffered in releasing us. It is my beleif they were one of the finest combat units that fought in Europe.

Ji Xianlin was one of them. <i>The Cowshed</i> is Ji&#x2019;s harrowing account of his imprisonment in 1968 on the campus of Peking University and his subsequent disillusionment with the cult of Mao. As the campus spirals into a political frenzy, Ji, a professor of Eastern languages, is persecuted by lecturers and students from his own department. His home is raided, his most treasured possessions are destroyed, and Ji himself must endure hours of humiliation at brutal &#x201c;struggle sessions.&#x201d; He is forced to construct a cowshed (a makeshift prison for intellectuals who were labeled class enemies) in which he is then housed with other former colleagues. His eyewitness account of this excruciating experience is full of sharp irony, empathy, and remarkable insights into a central event in Chinese history.<br><br>In contemporary China, the Cultural Revolution remains a delicate topic, little discussed, but if a Chinese citizen has read one book on the subject, it is likely to be Ji&#x2019;s memoir. When <i>The Cowshed</i> was published in China in 1998, it quickly became a bestseller. The Cultural Revolution had nearly disappeared from the collective memory. Prominent intellectuals rarely spoke openly about the revolution, and books on the subject were almost nonexistent. By the time of Ji&#x2019;s death in 2009, little had changed, and despite its popularity, <i>The Cowshed</i> remains one of the only testimonies of its kind. As Zha Jianying writes in the introduction, &#x201c;The book has sold well and stayed in print. But authorities also quietly took steps to restrict public discussion of the memoir, as its subject continues to be treated as sensitive. The present English edition, skillfully translated by Chenxin Jiang, is hence a welcome, valuable addition to the small body of work in this genre. It makes an important contribution to our understanding of that period.&#x201d;</p><p><b>Ji Xianlin</b> (1911&#x2013;2009) was born in the impoverished flatlands of Shandong Province, only weeks before the Qing government was overthrown, and educated in Germany in the 1930s.

Yet, despite commitment, care, and communication, a marriage will sometimes falter. When it does, the good news is that it can be made wonderful again. Following her landmark <em>Getting to "I Do",</em> Patricia Allen, the "Love Doctor" to over five thousand happily married couples, shares her proven methods for making a marriage come alive with love, passion, intimacy, and openness.<p> Dr. Allen's methods are so simple and basic as to be revolutionary. In each of us there is masculine energy, which leads, provides, and cherishes; and feminine energy, which follows, respects, and responds, sexually and lovingly. In a modern marriage, where freedom of choice can be perplexing, these energies must blend and flow together. They must complement each other; they must not compete. Once we acknowledge our individual energies and learn to communicate appropriately the ground is set for a truly satisfying marriage--physically, mentally, and emotionally.</p></p><p>Dr. Patricia Allen, who co-authored <b>Getting to "I Do"</b>, is a psychotherapist with an extensive marriage and family practice in Los Angeles, where her Monday-night workshops at the Century City Playhouse have been attended by thousands. She lives with her husband in Newport Beach and has four grandchildren. <p> Sandra Harmon, who co-authored <b>Getting to "I Do"</b>, is an Emmy Award-winning writer who collaborated with Priscilla Presley on the best-seller <b>Elvis and Me</b>. She is single and lives in New York City.</p>In the old days, men were men and women were women, but this is no longer true. Today we have multiple choices, and we need new concepts if we are to mate and marry and stay married. With poor role modeling by divorced parents, and conflicting media images of maleness and femaleness, men and women are creating a mixture of old traditions and new-age values to the confusion of everyone. Western culture has traditionally cast men as the protectors, leaders, and predominant doers. Men have traditionally proposed to women, have conferred status upon women, and have been the security providers. Women, on the other hand, have been the domesticators, the followers, the recipients-they have made themselves available to the life plans of men and have been responsive to male needs. Maleness, in this scheme, is the pragmatic, functional way in which we handle work and initiate action. It is verbal, centered in the left lobe of the brain. Femaleness is the passive, the receptive, the emotional centered in the right lobe of the brain; it can be represented as nonverbal energy. Its function in traditional terms is to serve as an outlet for emotion and a moral brake; it can be seen as the stable center that allows a relationship to develop and be maintained. <p> Although both male and female elements are vital to the makeup of both men and women, for a relationship to be healthy and successful, they must be reconciled and be complementary. In other words, there can only be one male and one female in every relationship.</p></p><h2>The House of the Dead: Siberian Exile Under the Tsars</h2><p><b>Winner of the Cundill History Prize&nbsp;</b><br><br>A visceral, hundred-year history of the vast Russian penal colony. <br><br>It was known as 'the vast prison without a roof.' From the beginning of the nineteenth century until the Russian Revolution, the tsars exiled more than one million prisoners and their families beyond the Ural Mountains to Siberia.&nbsp; Daniel Beer illuminates both the brutal realities of this inhuman system and the tragic and inspiring fates of those who endured it. Here are the vividly told stories of petty criminals and mass murderers, bookish radicals and violent terrorists, fugitives and bounty hunters, and the innocent women and children who followed their husbands and fathers into exile.<br><br> Siberia was intended to serve not only as a dumping ground for criminals but also as a colony. Just as exile would purge Russia of its villains so too would it purge villains of their vices. In theory, Russia&#x2019;s most unruly criminals would be transformed into hardy frontiersmen and settlers. But in reality, the system peopled Siberia with an army of destitute and desperate vagabonds who visited a plague of crime on the indigenous population. &nbsp;Even the aim of securing law and order in the rest of the Empire met with disaster: Expecting Siberia also to provide the ultimate quarantine against rebellion, the tsars condemned generations of republicans, nationalists and socialists to oblivion thousands of kilometers from Moscow. Over the nineteenth century, however, these political exiles transformed Siberia's mines, settlements and penal forts into a virtual laboratory of revolution. Exile became the defining experience for the men and women who would one day rule the Soviet Union.<br><br> Unearthing a treasure trove of new archival evidence, this masterly and original work tells the epic story of Russia's struggle to govern its prison continent and Siberia's own decisive influence on the political forces of the modern world. In <i>The House of the Dead</i>, Daniel Beer brings to light a dark and gripping reality of mythic proportions.</p><p><b>DANIEL BEER</b> is senior lecturer in the Department of History at Royal Holloway, University of London. He has written widely on nineteenth-century Russia and is the author of <i>Renovating Russia: The Human Sciences and the Fate of Liberal Modernity, 1880-1930.</i>Prologue <br> The Bell of Uglich <br> &nbsp;<br> In 1891, a group of Russian merchants successfully petitioned Tsar Alexander III to allow them to transport a 300-kilogramme copper bell from the Siberian town of Tobolsk to its native town of Uglich, 2,200 kilometres to the west. The bell travelled up the Volga River in the late spring of 1892 and arrived by steamship at a jetty erected in front of the Uglich cathedral. There, it received a ceremonial homecoming exactly three centuries after having first been exiled to Siberia. <br> &nbsp;<br> The bell&#x2019;s fate had been sealed in the spring of 1591, when the nine-year-old son and designated heir of Ivan the Terrible, Tsarevich Dmitry, was found in Uglich with his throat slit. Dmitry&#x2019;s mother and her family believed that the tsarevich had been murdered on the orders of a potential rival to the throne, the tsar regent, Boris Godunov. They rang Uglich&#x2019;s bell to summon the townspeople in revolt. The Uglichans formed a mob and went on the rampage, murdering both the presumed assassins and an official from Moscow. The unrest attracted the Kremlin&#x2019;s wrath. Godunov ordered forces to Uglich to quash the rebellion, and the following spring, he dispensed justice. He had some 200 townspeople executed and others imprisoned; about 100 were flogged and had their nostrils torn out; the more eloquent lost their tongues as well. Scourged and mutilated, the rebels were banished to Siberia. <br> &nbsp;<br> In addition to inflicting retribution on the insurgents, Godunov punished the symbol of their political unity. He had the bell lowered, subjected to twelve lashes, relieved of its &#x201c;tongue&#x201d; and then exiled to Siberia. The Uglichans were made to drag the mutinous bell across the Urals before finally bringing it to rest in Tobolsk, where the town&#x2019;s military governor registered it as &#x201c;the first inanimate exile.&#x201d; Silenced and banished, the bell became a testament to the power of Russia&#x2019;s rulers both to drive their turbulent subjects beyond the Urals and to strike them dumb.<br> &nbsp;<br> Yet in the centuries that followed it also became a rallying point for opponents of the autocracy who viewed Godunov&#x2019;s punishment of the Uglichans as the cruel act of a usurper. In 1862, one nobleman exiled to Tobolsk, Ippolit Zavalishin, discerned in the Uglich Bell an &#x201c;unquelled accuser who bears eloquent testimony to . . . the punishment of an entire blameless town!&#x201d; By the middle of the nineteenth century, then, the bell had come to symbolize not only the supreme authority of the sovereign but also the vengeful power on which it relied. <br> &nbsp;<br> Tobolsk played a central role in the development of Siberian exile in the centuries after the banishment of the Uglich Bell. This legacy is still visible today in the jumble of decaying wooden houses and neoclassical buildings that make up the old town. Tobolsk&#x2019;s central square sits atop a plateau that rears 50 metres above the muddy waters of the great River Irtysh and the lower town that sprawls to the south. It commands distant views of the surrounding countryside and the barges inching their way upstream. Two large buildings bestride the square. One is the stone kremlin, a fortified complex that projected the power and splendour of the imperial state. Its massive white walls, above which soar the blue and gold cupolas of the Sofia Cathedral, were built by exiles: Swedish soldiers taken prisoner by Peter the Great in 1709 at one of the decisive battles of the Great Northern War (1700&#x2013;1721). The second building, whose imposing neoclassical fa�ade spans the length of the square&#x2019;s western edge, is the Tobolsk Central Penal Labour Prison. Built in the early 1850s, the prison was the second of its kind in the town, adding much needed capacity to the existing ramshackle jail. Convoys numbering hundreds of exiles would be marched up into the town, across the square and through its gates, to be held in the prison while the Tobolsk Exile Office, the administrative centre of the entire exile system, determined their final destinations. Distributed into new convoys, the exiles would then set off on the roads and waterways of Siberia, bound for distant villages and penal settlements. Tobolsk was the gateway to a continental prison.<br> &nbsp;<br> The exile system played a central role in the colonization of Siberia. Towns grew up around Siberian penal forts and colonies to house their officials and military personnel. Rare was the Siberian village left untouched by the exiles who either officially settled almost every district in every Siberian province or unofficially roamed through them as itinerant labourers, thieves and beggars. Siberia&#x2019;s roads were dotted with the squat ochre waystations in which the marching convoys of deportees would overnight on their long and gruelling journey. The forwarding prisons, city jails, mines, industrial enterprises and exile settlements resembled sinews of state power that stretched eastwards from St. Petersburg. When, in 1879, a devastating fire consumed three-quarters of the centre of Irkutsk&#x2014;then a thriving city of 30,000 inhabitants&#x2014;one of the few stone buildings to survive the flames was the central prison. Its significance as a major transit point for exiles was laid bare as it suddenly loomed above the smouldering ruins of the city.<br> &nbsp;<br> The Tobolsk Central Penal Labour Prison continued to serve as a penal institution until 1989, when the authorities finally shut it down. Like many of the tsarist-era prisons, it had been refurbished after 1917 and eventually become part of what Alexander Solzhenitsyn would call the &#x201c;archipelago&#x201d; of penal facilities that formed the Stalinist Gulag. Both in Russia and abroad, the Gulag has overlaid memories of the tsars&#x2019; use of Siberia as a place of punishment. Long before the Soviet state erected its camps, however, Siberia was already a vast open prison with a history spanning more than three centuries.<br> &nbsp;<br> Siberia&#x2014;the Russian name <i>&#x421;&#x438;&#x431;&#x438;&#x440;&#x44c;</i> is pronounced <i>Seebeer</i>&#x2014;dwarfs European Russia. At 15,500,000 square kilometres, it is one and a half times larger than the continent of Europe. Siberia has never had an independent political existence; it has no clear borders and no binding ethnic identity. Its modern history is inseparable from Russia&#x2019;s. The easily surmountable Ural Mountains have acted less as a physical boundary than as the imaginative and political frontier of a European Russia beyond which lay a giant Asiatic colony and a sprawling penal realm. Siberia was both Russia&#x2019;s heart of darkness and a world of opportunity and prosperity. The continent&#x2019;s bleak and unforgiving present was to give way to a brighter future, and Siberia&#x2019;s exiles were intended to play a key role in this vaunted transition.<br> &nbsp;<br> For the imperial state sought to do more than cage social and political disorder within its continental prison. By purging the old world of its undesirables, it would also populate the new. The exile system promised to harness a growing army of exiles in the service of a wider project to colonize Siberia. In theory, Russia&#x2019;s criminals would toil to harvest Siberia&#x2019;s natural riches and settle its remote territories and, in so doing, they would discover the virtues of self-reliance, abstinence and hard work. In practice, however, the exile system dispatched into the Siberian hinterland an army not of enterprising settlers but of destitute and desperate vagabonds. They survived not by their own industry but by stealing and begging from the real colonists, the Siberian peasantry. The tensions embedded in this dual status of &#x201c;prison colony&#x201d; were never reconciled over the more than three centuries separating the banishment of the Uglichan insurgents and the implosion of the tsarist empire in 1917. Contrary to the ambitions of Russia&#x2019;s rulers, penal colonization never became a driving force behind Siberia&#x2019;s development. Rather, as the numbers of exiles grew, it became an ever greater obstacle to it.<br> &nbsp;<br> Over the nineteenth century, the scale and intensity of Siberian exile increased so significantly that it easily surpassed the exile systems of the British and French empires. The British transported around 160,000 convicts to Australia in the eight decades between 1787 and 1868; the French state meanwhile had a penal population of about 5,500 in its overseas colonies between 1860 and 1900. By contrast, between 1801 and 1917, more than 1 million tsarist subjects were banished to Siberia.<br> &nbsp;<br> Among those exiles were generations of revolutionaries from towns and cities in European Russia and Poland. Some fought for a liberal constitution, some for national independence and still others for a socialist utopia. Siberia became a desolate staging post in the overlapping histories of European republicanism and the Russian revolutionary movement. By the end of the nineteenth century, the tsarist government was deporting thousands of dedicated revolutionaries to prisons, mines and far-flung settlements in Siberia. Amid the isolation and claustrophobia, they bickered, plotted and published political tracts to inspire and to coordinate the revolutionary underground in Russia&#x2019;s major cities. Their dreams of impending revolution, undiluted by the compromises of practical politics, filled the yawning Siberian skies. Siberia had become a gigantic laboratory of revolution and exile, a rite of passage for the men and women who would one day rule Russia. When revolution finally erupted in 1905, these exiled radicals transformed Siberia&#x2019;s towns and villages into crucibles of violent struggle against the autocracy. Scaffolds were erected in the courtyards of prisons while, beyond their walls, warders were assassinated in the streets. No longer a quarantine against the contagions of revolution, Siberia had become a source of the infection.<br> &nbsp;<br> The biographies and writings of a few luminaries dominate historical memory of Siberian exile before the Russian Revolution. Some, such as Fyodor Dostoevsky and Vladimir Lenin, were themselves exiles; others, like Anton Chekhov and Leo Tolstoy, penned vivid portraits of convict life in Siberia in their reportage and fiction. In 1861&#x2013;2, amid the &#x201c;thaw&#x201d; of Alexander II&#x2019;s Great Reforms, Dostoevsky published his acclaimed semi-autobiographical novel, the title of which is usually rendered in English as <i>Notes from the House of the Dead</i>, though the original Russian title translates more accurately as <i>Notes from the Dead House</i>, underlining Dostoevsky&#x2019;s belief that, whatever their crimes, the exiles ultimately fell victim to a brutal and dehumanizing prison system: a house of the dead. <br> &nbsp;<br> Thereafter, the annual trickle of articles, memoirs and works of fiction on the exile system became a torrent that surged unabated through the final decades of the tsarist era. The Russian press carried anguished discussions of the horrors of the exile system and its disastrous consequences for Siberia itself. Other celebrated writers and artists followed in Dostoevsky&#x2019;s footsteps. In Chekhov&#x2019;s story <i>In Exile </i>(1892), the long years of banishment in Siberia have stripped an ageing ferryman of all compassion, hope and desire. The former exile is, his young companion exclaims, &#x201c;no longer alive, a stone, clay.&#x201d; By the time Ilya Repin painted his <i>Unexpected Return</i> in 1884, the hollowed-out stare of the gaunt young man entering his family&#x2019;s dining room and the confused and shocked reaction of his relatives needed no explanation. Each and every one of Repin&#x2019;s contemporaries understood that the scene depicted the homecoming of a political exile. Repin&#x2019;s painting belonged to a shared <i>imaginative</i> canvas of the banishment, cruelty and suffering that were indelibly associated with Siberia. When, in 1892, Alexander III finally granted permission for the exiled bell of Uglich to be returned to its original home, the Russian press hailed the gesture as an expression of the monarch&#x2019;s magnanimity. But in the glare of mounting public revulsion at the disastrous penal colonization of a continent, the return of the bell looked more like an acknowledgement of failure, even defeat.<br> &nbsp;<br> Abroad, too, exile was blackening the name of the autocracy. In 1880, the British satirical magazine <i>Judy</i> published a cartoon that neatly summarized the views of many Western observers. It depicts the Russian bear dressed as a gendarme, bearing a &#x201c;torch of civilization&#x201d; and leading a seemingly endless column of prisoners in chains to Siberia. The plight of Russian and Polish political prisoners in exile evoked outraged sympathy from audiences in Europe and the United States who denounced the tyranny of the autocracy. The most eloquent and well-informed foreign spokesman for the empire&#x2019;s political prisoners abroad was the American journalist and explorer George Kennan. Originally sympathetic to the Russian government&#x2019;s struggle with what he believed to be dangerous fanatics, in the late 1880s Kennan received permission from the Ministry of the Interior to travel unimpeded throughout Siberia and to report on what he found. What he discovered were thousands of men and women who were not, he argued, deranged and dangerous radicals, but rather martyrs to the cause of freedom. Across the world, Siberia was fast becoming a byword for the despotism of the tsars.<br> &nbsp;<br> Yet if the individual fates of famous writers and revolutionaries in Siberia became widely known and discussed both in Russia and abroad, the same could not be said of the vast majority of Siberia&#x2019;s exiles. For every banished radical, thousands of unknown common criminals and their families were marched off to Siberia and into oblivion. Most were illiterate and lacked the resources required to record their experiences for posterity. Their fates survive only in the police reports, petitions, court records and official correspondence that were compiled and retained by the apparatus of an increasingly developed and sophisticated police state. These documents, stitched into bundles and filed away in rough cardboard folders in the dusty and decaying collections of tsarist ministries, are today held in archives in Moscow, St. Petersburg and towns and cities across Siberia.<br> &nbsp;<br> It is from this body of archival evidence and from the welter of published memoirs and diaries that this book recovers the experiences of revolutionaries and common criminals in Siberia from Alexander I&#x2019;s coronation in 1801 to Nicholas II&#x2019;s abdication in 1917. Their voices tell the story of Russia&#x2019;s struggle to govern its prison empire as the tsarist regime collided violently with the political forces of the modern world.</p><h2>Breakthroughs (The Great War, Book 3)</h2><p>Is it the war to end all wars--or war without end?

The focus of the series is always on the King. After an attack on a small Terrestrian village by Argamor&#39;s dark knights, the villagers petition King Emmanuel to build them a castle for protection. Emmanuel responds by sending James of Arwyn, a master builder who will guide the villagers in the construction of their own castle. All goes well until the workers discover mysterious golden lamps. The lamps possess strange powers, and those powers may spell doom for the castle project. This sixth adventure will cause the reader to realize that the King&#39;s business must always be priority. This is not Narnia; this is not Lord of the Rings. The Terrestria Chronicles were written to honor Christ and be as true to Scripture as possible. Some readers have compared the Terrestria books to The Pilgrim&#39;s Progress, though this series is much more readable, relevant, and action-packed than Bunyan&#39;s classic work. Written for ages ten and up, the Terrestria series is ideal for family devotions, classroom use, or individual enjoyment.</p><p>Evangelist Ed Dunlop Ed Dunlop has worked in children&#39;s ministries full-time for thirty-two years. As an evangelist, he conducts Kids Crusades in local churches, presents teacher-training seminars, speaks at junior camps, and conducts visualized drug and alcohol awareness programs in public elementary and junior high schools. His ministry involves ventriloquism, Gospel magic, blacklight effects, and a variety of other visual media. Ed writes fiction for children and resource books for teachers, and currently has twenty-four titles in print with five publishers. His books for teachers, I Can&#39;t Wait Till Sunday Morning! and How Do I Get These Kids to Listen? are bestsellers with Sword Publishers. His Young Refugee historical series includes Escape to Liechtenstein and The Incredible Rescues. His latest allegory series, the seven title Terrestria Chronicles, is a must-read for any family raising children in today s society. The author grew up in Phoenix, Arizona. He was raised in a Christian home and was led to Christ as a young child by his mother. He graduated from Pacific Coast Baptist Bible College in 1975 at the age of nineteen, and has served churches in California, Arizona, and Tennessee as assistant pastor and Christian Education Director. He and his family entered full-time evangelism in March of 1988. Ed and his wife, Janice, have three children, Rebecca, Steve and Phillip, and make their home in north Georgia. Ed enjoys canoeing, motorcycling and SCUBA diving. His sons are also certified divers. Ed currently serves as a volunteer diver at the Tennessee Aquarium in Chattanooga, Tennessee, and enjoys feeding the fish, sharks, stingrays and moray eels as groups of school children watch.The series centers around a medieval theme of knights, princesses, castles, etc. Christ is King Emmanuel and the King saves the main character, Josiah, from Argamor (Satan) in the first book. After Josiah is brought into the Kingdom of Terrestria, he is mentored by Sir Faithful and learns what it means to be a son of the King. In each book, Josiah undergoes various trials and learns about faith, the power of his King, and that he cannot rely on his own power to gain success. In the third book, The Search for Everyman, two more main characters are introduced Prince Selwyn and his sister, Princess Gilda. They aid Josiah in his many adventures throughout the rest of the series. One aspect of the books that I really liked was the naming of many of the many peoples and places: Sir Wisdom, the Path of Righteousness, the Castle of Faith, Captain Temptation, Woebegone, Discouragement and so on. The series is written for ages 10 and up; some younger readers won&#39;t know the definition of some of these names, but they will get a general understanding of their meanings after reading through these books! The Biblical principles that are taught in this book are sound and I found the allegories in each story helpful in showing me a new way to look at the lessons in the Bible. I don&#39;t want to give any specific examples, but I loved the way that the author takes modern day items and ideas and shows how they are Satan&#39;s tools for trying to draw us away from our Lord. We are encouraged over and over again to make Christ our first priority and shown the value of doing so. My favorite book was The Great War which tells the story of the book of Revelation in terms that a child can understand. It is the final book in the series and depicts the greatness of our King, leaving a lasting impression in my mind. I thought about this book for several days afterwards. I plan to read this series with my son as his Bible study during our upcoming school year. We will go through one book monthly, reading and discussing each story and learning more about our King of kings and Lord of lords! I know that he will be enraptured by the fantasy setting and able to identify with Josiah. I have read a modified children s version of The Pilgrim&#39;s Progress with my children, but I believe that The Terrestria Chronicles are much easier to understand while getting many of the same points across to the reader.

Danni Cafferty and Michael Quinn are happy to accept an invitation to a new couples resort from a friend of Danni&#x2019;s. Since inheriting her father&#x2019;s collectible&#x2019;s and antique shop in New Orleans and meeting Quinn, Danni&#x2019;s life has been turned upside down and nothing about their relationship has been normal or relaxing, so the invitation is a great chance to let their lives as a couple flourish as they simply enjoy whirlpools, hot steam, perhaps a few decadent chocolates and some bubbling champagne. But, maybe ordinary isn&#x2019;t in the cards for Cafferty and Quinn. When their first day poolside is interrupted by news of strange deaths in a nearby historic cemetery that&#x2019;s rumored to be cursed, champagne and chocolates have to take a back seat. Three corpses have been found strung up like scarecrows while a mirror set of murders has happened back home in New Orleans, creating an aura of fear that the grisly event could occur yet again. Sometimes it&#x2019;s better to just play to your strengths. Now it&#x2019;s up to Danni and Quinn to see if they can discover the truth between fact and legend before a killer can strike again.</p><p></p><h2>The Culture of Defeat: On National Trauma, Mourning, and Recovery</h2><p>A fascinating look at history's losers-the myths they create to cope with defeat and the steps they take never to be vanquished again<br><br>History may be written by the victors, Wolfgang Schivelbusch argues in his brilliant and provocative new book, but the losers often have the final word. Focusing on three seminal cases of modern warfare-the South after the Civil War, France in the wake of the Franco-Prussian War, and Germany following World War I-Schivelbusch reveals the complex psychological and cultural reactions of vanquished nations to the experience of military defeat.<br><br>Drawing on responses from every level of society, Schivelbusch shows how conquered societies question the foundations of their identities and strive to emulate the victors: the South to become a "better North," the French to militarize their schools on the Prussian model, the Germans to adopt all things American. He charts the losers' paradoxical equation of military failure with cultural superiority as they generate myths to glorify their pasts and explain their losses: the nostalgic "plantation legend" after the fall of the Confederacy; the cult of Joan of Arc in vanquished France; the fiction of the stab in the back by "foreign" elements in postwar Germany. From cathartic epidemics of "dance madness" to the revolutions that so often follow battlefield humiliation, Schivelbusch finds remarkable similarities across cultures.<br><br>Eloquently and vibrantly told, <i>The Culture of Defeat</i> is a tour de force that opens new territory for historical inquiry.<br></p><p>Wolfgang Schivelbusch, who has been called "a master of cultural history," is an independent scholar who divides his time between New York and Berlin.

One was a self-taught, middle-aged Virginia planter in charge of a ragtag army of revolutionaries, the other a rich, glory-seeking teenage French aristocrat. But the childless Washington and the orphaned Lafayette forged a bond between them as strong as any between father and son. It was an unbreakable trust that saw them through betrayals, shifting political alliances, and the trials of war.<br><br>Lafayette came to America a rebellious youth whose defiance of his king made him a celebrity in France. His money and connections attracted the favor of the Continental Congress, which advised Washington to keep the exuberant Marquis from getting himself killed. But when the boy-general was wounded in his first battle, he became a hero of two countries. As the war ground on, Washington found in his young charge the makings of a courageous and talented commander whose loyalty, generosity, and eagerness to please his Commander in Chief made him one of the war&#x2019;s most effective and inspired generals. Lafayette&#x2019;s hounding of Cornwallis&#x2019;s army was the perfect demonstration of Washington&#x2019;s unconventional &#x201c;bush-fighting&#x201d; tactics, and led to the British surrender at Yorktown.<br><br>Their friendship continued throughout their lives. Lafayette inspired widespread French support for a struggling young America and personally influenced Washington&#x2019;s antislavery views. Washington&#x2019;s enduring example as general and statesman guided Lafayette during France&#x2019;s own revolution years later.<br><br>Using personal letters and other key historical documents, Adopted Son offers a rare glimpse of the American Revolution through the friendship between Washington and Lafayette. It offers dramatic accounts of battles and intimate portraits of such major figures as Alexander Hamilton, Benedict Arnold, and Benjamin Franklin. The result is a remarkable, little-known epic of friendship, revolution, and the birth of a nation.</p><p>David A.

In its level spaces it supported farming on its rich volcanic soil. Sheep grazed on the gentler slopes surrounding the fields, and hogs rooted on the edges of the woodlands. Around them, the tortured, wooded mountains inspired fears. It was a land of ignorance, superstition, hard labor, and poverty.<br><br>A journey to Paris, about 200 miles north, took more than two weeks in 1757. The area had always been isolated, owing to the rugged landscape and bad roads. Those same qualities had given the province a tragic place in history. In 52 bc, the town of Alesia in Auvergne was the last stronghold of the Celtic Gauls (called the Avernii by the Romans). Under Vercingetorix, they had fought the conquering Roman armies through years of brutal combat. The mighty power of the Roman Empire told on the Gauls, however, until the last resisters, about 80,000 of them, were surrounded by Julius Caesar's troops and earthworks.<br><br>An army of Belgii, another Celtic nation, marched to their relief, but the Romans slaughtered them to the last man. Vercingetorix offered to surrender Alesia and offer himself as a hostage to spare the lives of his people. Caesar accepted, then ordered his troops to massacre the Gaulish soldiers and sold the people into slavery, scattering them across the Empire. He sent Vercingetorix to Rome, where he was beheaded as an <i>insurgentus</i>.<br><br>Gaul ceased to exist except as a province of the Roman Empire. Celtic was no longer spoken and was replaced by the Low Latin of the Roman soldiers. Over the centuries, that Latin became French, and what once was Gaul became France.<br>THE FAMILY'S MISFORTUNES IN WAR BECAME A <br>KIND OF PROVERB<br>Lafayette was born on September 6, 1757, in the same room of the Ch�teau de Chavaniac as his father before him, the top-floor chamber of one of the building's corner towers. The house&#x2013;built in the pseudo-castle "Ch�teau style" on the foundations of a real castle that had burned down in the 1690s&#x2013;was a Normanesque pile of stone with twenty large rooms and a slate roof. It was as cold as a barn in the winter despite its many large fireplaces. The Ch�teau was separated from the neighboring village of Chavaniac by a moat, just as its neighborhood was separated from the rest of France by the forbidding landscape of Auvergne.<br><br>The hereditary title of marquis, for a nobleman of middling rank, had been in the family for three generations, a reward for military service to the king. The clan could be traced back as far as the year 1000, and members had served in France's wars ever since.&nbsp; But Lafayette was descended from a line of younger sons (eldest sons inherited properties and titles), most of them Champeti�res who traced back to the thirteenth century. The history of Lafayette's forebears was a litany of younger sons who started out in poverty, married well, sired offspring, and went off to war to die young. They were close enough to Paris and Versailles to answer the call to arms but not near enough to be influential at court. They were provincial nobility, country bumpkins compared to the courtiers, glittering peacocks who surrounded the throne.<br><br>Nearly all Lafayette's ancestors had been warriors of greater or lesser repute. His great-grandfather Charles, a veteran soldier with a sterling reputation, began the family's rise out of recurrent poverty, founding its permanent fortune and receiving the title marquis de La Fayette. Charles' son Edouard married very well, acquiring Chavaniac along with his bride, and expanded his land holdings. His most notable military accomplishment was to fall off his horse and crack his head in front of the king. He survived long enough to produce two sons, Jacques-Roch and Gilbert, Lafayette's father. He left behind a domain that stretched thirty-five miles across Auvergne and seventy-five miles north to south, which Jacques-Roch would inherit.<br><br>However, Jacques-Roch died in a fierce battle with the Austrians when Lafayette's father was two. That left Gilbert holding in his little hands the family name and estates. He married Marie-Louise-Julie de La Rivi�re, daughter of an ancient line of wealthy nobles. Her dowry extended his real estate into Brittany and gave him, for the first time in the family's history, connections to the inner circle around the king. Her grandfather, the comte de La Rivi�re, commanded the Mousquetaires du Roi (King's Musketeers, later made famous by Alexandre Dumas' novel <i>The Three Musketeers</i>). Known as the Black and Gray Musketeers, the outfit was the king's personal horse guard.<br><br>It was a Catholic country, and infant mortality rates were high in 1757, so the newest Lafayette's prompt baptism was imperative, lest his baby soul end up in Limbo. It took place at the nearby parish church a few days after his birth, delayed to give his mother a chance to recover enough to attend. She did not make it. Neither did his father, who was away at war. His maternal grandfather, the marquis de La Rivi�re, had been expected, but the journey from Paris took too long. Lafayette's paternal grandmother, Marie-Catherine de Chavaniac, served as godmother, while his cousin the Abb� de Murat presided. He was baptized "the very high and very mighty lord Monseigneur Marie-Joseph-Paul-Yves-Roch-Gilbert du Motier de La Fayette, legitimate son of the very high and very mighty lord Monseigneur Michel-Louis-Christophe-Roch-Gilbert du Motier, marquis de La Fayette, baron de Vissac, lord of Saint-Romain and other places, and of the very high and very mighty lady Madame Marie-Louise-Julie de La Rivi�re."<br><br>As this considerable mouthful of a name reflected, Lafayette's mother was a devoted Catholic, a habit that did not rub off on him. "I was baptized like a Spaniard," he said later, "and with no intention to deny myself the protection of Marie, Paul, Joseph, Roch, and Yves, I have most often called upon St. Gilbert," a wry reference not to the saint but to himself. His name, he told a correspondent, included that of every saint who might protect him in battle. So many Lafayettes had died fighting for France that "the family's misfortunes in war became a kind of proverb throughout the province."<br><br>Lafayette descended from a long line of orphans, whose sires achieved fatherhood a few jumps ahead of the Fatal Bullet. He joined their ranks before he was two years old, when his father was killed on August 1, 1759, at the Battle of Minden in Germany, while serving as a colonel of grenadiers in the French army. In one of the biggest battles of the Seven Years' War, the French lost about 5,000 men killed and wounded and several thousand more captured.<br><br>The elder Lafayette's commander had been ordered to keep his men below the skyline but rashly exposed them. When his immediate superior was killed, Lafayette stepped up to replace him, and as his son described it a half century later, he "was at once carried off by a ball from an English battery, commanded by a certain General Phillips."<br><br>William Phillips was at the time a twenty-eight-year-old captain in the British Royal Artillery, mentioned in dispatches for his "superlative practice" at Minden. In his next battle he became the first artillerist in history to bring his guns into action at a gallop. Lafayette would run across him later. "By a strange coincidence," he said, twenty-two years later two of his cannons opened fire on the English headquarters at Petersburg, Virginia. He claimed that one shot went through a house where Phillips was, killing him outright. This comment says much about Lafayette's accuracy as a chronicler of his own career, as Phillips died of disease, although the marquis did lob a cannonball his way.<br>FROM THE TIME I WAS EIGHT,<br>I LONGED FOR GLORY<br>Lafayette's father died, cut in two by English iron, before he had prepared a will. Young Gilbert succeeded to his feudal titles, while his widow reclaimed her dowry. Lafayette's grandmother appealed to the king for an allowance to raise him, and he granted a pension of 600 livres. Lafayette was not poor, however, because when his mother and grandmother died he could expect to receive an income of 25,000 livres. By the time he was four, an uncle died and he became future heir to the La Rivi�re fortune, with an annual income of 120,000 livres.<br><br>The boy marquis would not starve; a board of financial guardians would see to that. His family support was another matter. News of his father's death shattered his mother, who, consumed by her grief, abandoned him at Chavaniac and left for her family's home, the Luxembourg Palace in Paris. On April 5, 1760, barely eight months after the Battle of Minden, she gave birth to Lafayette's sister, who died less than three months later. Lafayette, growing up at Chavaniac, seldom saw his mother over the next several years.<br><br>Children often respond to the death of a parent with feelings of betrayal or abandonment and sometimes the fear that they are somehow to blame. Lafayette was too young to react that way toward his father's death, but having no fatherly presence left an empty space in his life. How he viewed his mother's absence&#x2013;she off amid the splendor of Paris and Versailles, either enjoying social life or indulging in religious observance&#x2013;will never be known. However much it must have affected him, in later years he was charitable rather than bitter toward her. "My mother," he said in one of his few references to her, "was a woman of lively temperament who had once had a liking for the frivolous, but after her husband's death had plunged ...</p><h2>The Provincial Lady in London</h2><p>These highly acclaimed, delightful novels are written in diary form by the Provincial Lady, who lives in a country house with her husband, two children, the children&#39;s French governess, Cook and a few assorted helpers.

His feverish and singular pursuit of this goal has come to define his life. Now an old man, he is looked on with suspicion and shame by his family-until his ambitious young nephew intervenes.<br>Seeking to understand his uncle's mysterious mind, the narrator of this novel unravels his story, a dramatic tale set against a tableau of brilliant historical figures-among them G. H. Hardy, the self-taught Indian genius Srinivasa Ramanujan, and a young Kurt G�del. Meanwhile, as Petros recounts his own life's work, a bond is formed between uncle and nephew, pulling each one deeper into mathematical obsession, and risking both of their sanity.</p></p><p>"Every family has its black sheep--in ours it was Uncle Petros." The narrator of Apostolos Doxiadis's first novel, <i>Uncle Petros and Goldbach's Conjecture</i>, is unable to understand the reasons for his uncle's fall from grace. A kindly, gentle recluse devoted only to gardening and chess, Petros Papachristos exhibits no sign of dissolution or indolence: so why is he held in such low esteem? One day, his brother reveals all: <blockquote> 'Your Uncle Petros cast pearls before swine; he took something holy and sacred and great, and shamelessly defiled it!' ... 'His <i>gift</i>, of course!' ... 'The great, unique gift that God had blessed him with, his phenomenal, unprecedented, mathematical talent! The miserable fool wasted it; he squandered it and threw it out with the garbage. Can you imagine it? The ungrateful bastard never did one day's useful work in mathematics. Never! Nothing! Zero!' </blockquote> Needless to say, such apoplexy only provokes the boy's curiosity, and what he eventually discovers is a story of obsession and frustration, of Uncle Petros's attempts at finding a proof for one of mathematics' great enigmas--Goldbach's Conjecture. <p> The innumerate may initially find this undramatic material for a novel. Yet Doxiadis offers up a beautifully imagined narrative, which reveals a rarefied world of the intellect that few people will ever enter, in which numbers are entirely animate entities, each possessed of "a distinct personality." Without ever alienating the reader, he demonstrates the enchantments of this art as well as the ambition, envy, and search for glory that permeate its apostles. Balancing the narrator's own awkward move into adulthood with the painful memories of his brilliant relative, Doxiadis shows how seductive the world of numbers can be, and how cruel a mistress. "A mathematician is born, not made," Petros declares--an inheritance that proves both a curse and a gift. <i>--Burhan Tufail</i></p>"A mathematical conjecture unsolved for two centuries; a mathematical genius uncle driven mad trying to solve it; an ambiguous relation with a mathematically-minded nephew; and acute human observation all come together in Uncle Petros to make a very funny, tender, charming and, to my mind, irresistible novel."--Oliver Sacks, M.D. <p>"Paints a fascinating picture of how a mathematician could fall into a mental trap by devoting his efforts to a too difficult problem."--John Nash, Nobel Laureate, 1994, subject of A Beautiful Mind </p><p>"It is brilliantly written-a mathematical detective story of great charm-and it certainly succeeds in capturing much of the spirit of mathematical research."--Sir Michael Atiyah, winner of the Fields Medal and world-renowned mathematician</p></p><h2>Coming of Age in the Milky Way</h2><p><p>From the second-century celestial models of Ptolemy to modern-day research institutes and quantum theory, this classic book offers a breathtaking tour of astronomy and the brilliant, eccentric personalities who have shaped it.

In 1982, Eduard Fornes curated the exhibition &#34;Dal� and His Books: Dal�, the Writer and Dal�, the Illustrator&#34; held in Barcelona, introducing the public to such lesser-known aspects of Salvador Dal�&#39;s career and creative spirit. More than 20 years later, the artist&#39;s extraordinary illustrations and extensive bibliography have been gathered to create Dal� - Illustrator. Dal� - Illustrator thoroughly categorizes the historic literary works of Salvador Dal�, and further documents the artist&#39;s personal relationship with the author, the distinguished publishing house Les Heures Clares, the Albaretto family, and Dr. A.

Hardcover. ISBN 0-525-07020-6. Small octavo, cloth. Fine (faintest possible foxing on closed page ends) in Near Fine DJ (price not clipped) . **Signed by Elkin on front end paper with his name only, no presentation inscription.</p><p>Stanley Elkin (1930-1995) was an award-winning author of novels, short stories, and essays. Born in the Bronx, Elkin received his BA and PhD from the University of Illinois and in 1960 became a professor of English at Washington University in St. Louis where he taught until his death. His critically acclaimed works include the National Book Critics Circle Award-winners &#34;George Mills&#34; (1982) and &#34;Mrs. Ted Bliss&#34; (1995), as well as the National Book Award finalists &#34;The Dick Gibson Show&#34; (1972), &#34;Searches and Seizures &#34;(1974), and &#34;The MacGuffin&#34; (1991). His book of novellas, &#34;Van Gogh&#39;s Room at Arles&#34;, was a finalist for the PEN Faulkner Award.This short novel exhibits the author&#39;s sardonic fatalism, a kind of humor so dark that, before the work closes, it&#39;s more sad--or angry--than funny. A basically good man dies in a stickup, finds himself in hell, whence proceed comic misadventures. Elkin gives his dramatis personae an endearing quality--except for God, who is a petulant, willful despot. George Guidall, one of the best audiobook narrators, misses none of the beats. Wisely, he reads with a comic tone, but without the comic timing of gags that would turn satire into the Three Stooges. He stints on none of the drama, yet pulls back on the bigger moments to keep them from turning bathetic. His interpretation conjures up a phantasmagoria by Hieronymus Bosch in a prankish mood. If he errs, it&#39;s in his inability to give Joseph, a minor character here as in the New Testament, the Yiddish inflections the author wrote for him. There is something of Dostoyevsky as much as of Elkin in Guidall&#39;s horrifically funny afterlife, something bigger than the text he reads from. Y.R.

Shortly afterwards, he took up a position as an assistant in a North Yorkshire practice where he remained, with the exception of his wartime service in the RAF, until his death in 1995. He wrote many books about Yorkshire country life, including some for children, but he is best known for his memoirs, beginning with If Only They Could Talk. The books were televised in the enormously popular series All Creatures Great and Small.After an evening among his tales, anyone with as much as a dog or a budgerigar will feel he should move to Darrowby at once. * Yorkshire Post * It&#39;s a pleasure to be in James Herriot&#39;s company. * Observer * Bulls with sunstroke, pigs on the run and a cake-eating Peke with a betting habit . . .

Originating in Egypt where they introduced the first ever forms of proto agriculture and left vast Cyclopean monuments and ruins, they migrated to the near East to escape the cataclysms that accompanied the end of the Ice Age. Among their greatest achievements was the creation of the Sphinx.</p><p>ANCIENT CIVILIZATIONS / MYTHOLOGY <br> <br>&#x201c;An exciting and original quest...important new facts concerning the mysterious origins of human civilization.&#x201d; <br>--Graham Hancock, author of <em>Fingerprints of the Gods</em> <br> <br>&#x201c;A magnificently researched work; its startling conclusions will undoubtedly reverberate over the coming decades.&#x201d; <br>--Nigel Jackson, author of <em>The Horned Piper</em> <br> <br>&#x201c;A fascinating piece of research which does much to bring the biblical world of Eden back into the historical spotlight...a major contribution to the study of the genesis of civilization.&#x201d; <br>--David Rohl, Egyptologist and author of <em>A Test of Time</em> <br> <br>Our mythology describes how beings of great beauty and intelligence, who served as messengers of God, fell from grace through pride. These angels, also known as Watchers, are spoken of in the Bible and other religious texts as lusting after human women, who lay with them and gave birth to giant offspring called Nephilim. Religious sources also record how these beings shared forbidden arts and sciences with humanity--a transgression that led to their destruction in the Great Flood. <br> <br>Andrew Collins reveals that these angels, demons, and fallen angels were flesh-and-blood members of a race predating our own. He offers evidence that they lived in Egypt prior to the ancient Egyptians and built the Sphinx and other megalithic monuments. Following the cataclysms that accompanied the last Ice Age they left the region for what is now eastern Turkey where they lived in isolation before gradually establishing contact with the developing human societies of the Mesopotamian plains below. Humanity regarded these angels--described as tall, white-haired beings with viperlike faces and burning eyes--as gods and their realm the paradise wherein grew the tree of knowledge. Andrew Collins demonstrates how the legends behind the fall of the Watchers echo the faded memory of actual historical events and that the legacy they have left humanity is one we can afford to ignore only at our own peril. <br> <br>ANDREW COLLINS has spent more than twenty years investigating the relationship between paranormal phenomena, ancient sites, and the human mind.

It is the personal and political story of how the nation's two top leaders prepared themselves to square off for the 1996 presidential election. </p><p>Never before has political reporting provided voters with so much authoritative, in-depth information on the candidates before a presidential election. <i>The Choice</i> sets the stage for the November 5, 1996, election with a study of the contenders in action-- their decisions, their conversations, their private assessments, their disappointments, their anger and triumphs, their definitions of themselves and their evolving understanding of national purpose. </p><p>Included in this wide-ranging political history is exclusive new material on the Republican primary contest; the White House and congressional budget battles; thetop secret Bosnia strategy sessions in the White House; the influence of Vice President Albert Gore, Jr., and House Speaker Newt Gingrich; the role of political money; the uses of public opinion polling and advertising; former General Colin Powell's decision not to run; and the strategies of both campaigns, including Dole's decision to leave the Senate and his consideration of possible running mates. </p><p>Woodward has dug deeply into the personal and political relationship between Clinton and Dole, revealing their private conversations as these most tested products of the American system attempt to balance political gain against the welfare of the country. <i>The Choice</i> is also a character study of the two men and their wives, Hillary Rodham Clinton and Elizabeth Dole.</p></p><p>No one gets the inside story like Bob Woodward, the reporter of the Watergate scandal who has made a career of investigating -- and writing about -- the inner workings of the highest levels of government. In <b>The Choice</b> he has produced a look at the two candidates for the 1996 presidential race, Bill Clinton and Bob Dole, published before the two parties' political conventions. The book details the political maneuvers endemic to the current climate: strategies, sessions, spins and ads aimed at repositioning and re-focusing either of the candidates in the light most favorable to the latest poll.

Most of us have matured from the "God-is-great, God-is-good" prayers of our childhood to more specific and sophisticated ones. Still, your prayer life may need more development to truly deepen your relationship with God. Consider that even the apostles asked of Jesus, "Lord, teach us to pray."</p><p> "True prayer moves us to act, and it is the root of our being transformed," Chilcote writes. "The way of Jesus is not a detached glory but a glory relevant. Prayer creates intimacy with God and reveals to us who we really are."</p><p> <i>Changed from Glory into Glory</i> will carry you on a Gospel prayer tour - from the Transfiguration through the Resurrection. As Chilcote says, ""We'll walk together through some of the most momentous events that shape our lives as Christians."" All the while, he guides us to see prayer's deeper purpose, which is to glimpse and commune with the divine.</p><p> Attentive prayer, responsive prayer, unceasing prayer and corporate worship are among the topics explored through art, hymns and reflections. Each chapter includes a scripture passage that introduces the central theme. Changed from Glory into Glory also features eight pages of beautiful color art reproductions to deepen your meditations.</p><p> The narrative of the biblical story and Chilcote's analysis of the multiple dimensions of prayer make this a perfect Lenten study for groups or individuals. Obviously, any time is a good time to pray or immerse yourself in a study about prayer. But if you're seeking a deeper walk with Christ, no time could be better.</p><p> This book is also ideal for Wesley scholars and seminarians.</p></p><p>Paul W. Chilcote is professor of the Practice of Evangelism at Duke University Divinity School. Chilcote previously served as Nippert Professor of Church History and Wesleyan Studies at the Methodist Theological School in Ohio and, more recently, helped to launch the new campus of Asbury Theological Seminary in Florida. Chilcote is the author of eight books. He is the president of The Charles Wesley Society, and enjoys a special relationship with Mount Angel Abbey in Oregon as a Benedictine oblate. Chilcote is a frequent speaker and workshop leader in applied Wesleyan studies, particularly in the areas of spirituality, worship, discipleship, and evangelism.&#34;My hope is that this book will help you wherever you happen to be in your life prayer, in young journey of transformation from one degree of glory into another... Regardless of how far you have come or how far you need to go, you have an amazing companion in the person of the Holy Spirit, who is, most certainly, our only real teacher in the life of prayer.&#34;</p><h2>Pioneer Women: The Lives of Women on the Frontier</h2><p>Provides an intimate look at the lives of pioneer women, based on journals, letters, and oral histories that evince the actual experience of pioneer life, from crossing the continent and the hardships and hazards of pioneer life to the struggle for women&#39;s rights.</p><p>The rarely seen and startlingly vital black-and-white photographs in this volume capture the fortitude and pride of the clear-eyed women of the frontier, women who had to practice all the tender arts of nurturing a family under the most rugged of circumstances. Peavy and Smith cut through all the myths of frontier life in their frank and engaging commentary, getting down to the cold, gritty facts under such headings as "Keeping Spirits Up," "Night Fears," "Warding Off Insects and Animals," and "Little Ones Lost." This litany alludes to the loneliness and isolation of pioneer existence, where every act, from securing clean drinking water to making clothes, required long, hard labor, and where pregnancy, childbirth, and motherhood often involved as much tragedy as joy. Little-discussed issues, such as marriages between Anglo men and Indian and Hispanic women, are examined, as are the lives of women who found employment outside the homestead as teachers, physicians, businesswomen, journalists, and even prostitutes. A book as fresh and inspiring as a bright, breezy day on the plains. <i>Donna Seaman</i></p><h2>Afghans &amp; Bed Runners for Knitting Looms: A Step-by-Step Guide for Creating 12 Stunning Projects on a Knitting Loom (Annie's Quilting)</h2><p><p>Perfect for beginners who have never so much as used a knitting board or those who have only made small accessories and want to move on to larger items, this guide offers a dozen projects, from afghans and bed runners to a pillow and even a wearable afghan.

He concentrates on ensuring that readers have a good understanding of the basics, from the ABCs of metallurgy to such complicated techniques as enameling and lacquering. In fact, included are a few resurrected methods; for instance, niello, an easily accomplished form of enameling, is often seen in eastern European silver pieces but rarely in the U.S. Most of the examples are contemporary, taken from European designers, and all blessed with great color photographs--as is the grand finale, the step-by-step how-tos of seven different pieces, detailed with words and in pictures, though none are really intended for rank beginners. An introduction for buyers as well as for budding artisans. <i>Barbara Jacobs</i><br><i>Copyright � American Library Association.

In content it is similar to Jinks McGrath's The Encyclopedia of Jewelry-Making Techniques (LJ 11/1/95) with the addition of a very useful chapter on the properties of metals (gold and silver) and seven step-by-step projects for contemporary jewelry. When the techniques have been mastered, it is time for Jewellery: Design Sourcebook, a gallery of photographs of jewelry as art featuring the creations of over 75 contemporary artists. From a practical standpoint most of these are unwearable, but this is a rather fascinating look at the art jewelry of today.

Selznick, plunged them into ruin</p><p>This lively, well-researched portrait of a doomed Hollywood marriage is packed with behind-the-scenes anecdotes (e.g., Jones flees the set of Since You Went Away after a love scene with estranged husband Walker). Linet, a veteran film writer, bases her characterizations of the principals in this ill-fated love triangle on recent interviews with Walker's close friends and relatives. There is nothing new on Jones, who did not cooperate with the author; she is depicted as an ambi- tious schemer. Walker's mental problems, according to Linet, stemmed from lifelong neglect of his emotional needs. Selznick, Jones's Svengali, flounders in middle age, his creativity corrupted by power and passion.

The monumental stone edifice, built in a stolid, neoclassical style, loomed behind the young blond woman, silent and dark. Roberta peered at her wristwatch; it was ten past two in the morning, only ninety seconds later than the last time she'd checked her watch. <i>What's keeping Seven and that darn cat?</i> she wondered anxiously. <i>They should be back by now.</i> </p><p> Restless and apprehensive, she strolled down the sidewalk, wincing at the sound of her own heels clicking against the pavement. The echo of her footsteps rang out far too loudly for Roberta's peace of mind. The last thing she wanted to do was attract the attention of the local cops or, worse yet, one of the innumerable informants working for the Stasi, the dreaded East German secret police. </p><p> Fortunately, Unter den Linden, the wide city boulevard running north past the embassy, seemed deserted at this ridiculously late hour. The only traffic she heard was an elevated train rattling by a few streets over. Roberta clung to the shadow cast by the huge building, keeping a safe distance from the streetlamps at either end of the block, while also maintaining a careful lookout for any sign of trouble. "C'mon, c'mon," she muttered impatiently, wishing Seven could hear her. <i>You'd think I'd be used to this sort of thing by now,</i> she thought; after all, she'd been working with Gary Seven, alias Supervisor 194, for nearly six years now, ever since that unforgettable afternoon in 1968 when she'd shown up for what she'd thought was an ordinary secretarial job, only to find herself caught up in a bizarre happening involving nuclear missiles, talking computers, and a starship from the future. </p><p> <i>Heck,</i> she mused, <i>what's a little East German espionage compared to some of the spacey shenanigans Seven has dragged me into over the last few years?</i> Nevertheless, she shivered beneath a heavy gray overcoat, and not just from the cold. The thick wool garment she wore was neither flattering nor fashionable, but it helped to preserve her anonymity while simultaneously warding off at least some of the winter's chill. A black beret and matching kerchief, the latter tied below her chin, concealed most of her tinted honey-blond hair, while her gloved hands were thrust deeply into the pockets of her coat for warmth. Her fidgety fingers toyed with a thin silver device, snugly stowed away in the right pocket, that looked and felt like a common fountain pen. A mere pen, however, wouldn't have reassured Roberta nearly as much as this particular mechanism, even as she prayed devoutly that she wouldn't have need to use the servo before this night was over. </p><p> A pair of headlights approached from the north and Roberta turned her back on the empty street. <i>Probably just a delivery truck making a late-night run,</i> she guessed, stepping deeper into the gloomy shadow of the embassy, but her heart raced a little faster anyway. Roberta held her breath, while casting a wistful glance southward toward the lights of the Brandenburg Gate, only a block and a half away. The imposing marble arches, along with their attendant armed border guards and vigilant watchdogs, marked the frontier between East and West Berlin, making the safety of the Allied Sectors seem tantalizingly close by. </p><p> Granted, those brown-uniformed guards were under orders to shoot any would-be escapees on sight, but Roberta couldn't help experiencing an irrational urge to make a run for it. <i>Don't be silly,</i> she scolded herself. <i>It's not going to come to that. Seven will be back any second now...I hope.</i> </p><p> A covered truck rumbled past her, and she breathed a sigh of relief as the unassuming vehicle rounded the corner two blocks farther up the boulevard, disappearing down the adjacent cross-street. <i>That would be Friedrichstrasse,</i> she remembered, mentally calling up the maps she'd memorized for this mission. Her briefing had been exhaustively thorough, but no amount of preparation was going to help her, she realized, if she got caught on the wrong side of the Iron Curtain. </p><p> A rueful smile lifted the corners of her lips. She could just imagine trying to explain her situation to a stone-faced Stasi interrogator: <i>No, no, I'm not affiliated with the CIA or the U.S. government at all. I'm actually working for an independent operator trained by a bunch of secretive extraterrestrials who want to keep humanity from nuking itself into extinction...</i>Boy, wouldn't that go over great with the Commies! She's probably end up in a Soviet asylum, if she wasn't simply shot at dawn. </p><p> <i>"Guten abend, fraulein,"</i> a voice whispered in her ear. </p><p> Gasping out loud, Roberta spun around to find a stranger standing beside her. Where the heck had he come from? In her effort to evade detection from the passing truck, she had completely overlooked the newcomer's arrival. <i>Sloppy, sloppy,</i> she castigated herself for her carelessness. <i>Some spy girl I am. Emma Peel would never let someone sneak up on her like this.</i> </p><p> Thankfully, the speaker did not look like much of a threat, at least not on the surface. To Roberta's vast relief, the man wore neither a police nor an army uniform; instead he looked like a middle-aged accountant or shopkeeper, out for a post-midnight stroll. The man was short and jowly, his balding head exposed to the frigid night air and a pair of plain, black spectacles perched upon his bulbous, somewhat florid nose. Like Roberta's, his hands had sought the warmth of his coat pockets, but, despite the cold, his face was flushed and red. <i>Germany's the beer-drinking capital of the world,</i> Roberta recalled. Maybe the stranger was just heading home after an especially long night at his favorite bar? </p><p> "Er, hello," Roberta replied uncertainly. She spoke in English, but her automatic translator, ingeniously disguised as a silver pendant shaped like a peace symbol, converted her awkward greeting into perfect German, just as her matching earrings conveniently translated the stranger's every utterance into English. <i>Beats a Berlitz course any day,</i> she thought, grateful for Seven's advanced alien technology. </p><p> "You shouldn't be out so late, pretty girl," the man warned her ominously. The avid gleam in his eyes, as well as a sinister smile, belied the cautionary nature of his words. Peering past the stranger's spectacles, Roberta flinched at the sight of the German's glazed, bloodshot eyes. <i>I haven't seen eyes that crazy since the last time Charlie Manson was on TV,</i> she thought, stepping backward and away from her unwelcome visitor. "Don't you know it's not safe?" he taunted her. His left hand emerged from his pocket, clutching the ivory handle of something that looked alarmingly like a closed switchblade. </p><p> Just my luck! Roberta lamented silently. You try to do a little innocent night's spying and what do you get? Attacked by some sort of psycho/mugger/ rapist! "Stay back!" she whispered hoarsely, afraid even now to raise her voice so near the soldiers guarding the gate. "I'll scream, I swear it!" </p><p> She was bluffing, of course. She didn't dare raise an alarm. That could compromise the entire mission, putting Seven in danger as well, not to mention the cat. </p><p> "Go ahead," the German said, licking his fleshy lips in anticipation. With a click, a silver blade sprang from the ivory handle, catching the light of the streetlamps. "Old Jack likes screams, especially from pretty young things who know they're about to die." </p><p> Roberta fumbled in her pocket for her servo, briefly losing track of the pen-shaped weapon amid a clutter of loose change and wadded-up Kleenex. Before she could seize hold of it again, her assailant's knife slashed across the outside of her coat, slicing through the fabric and sending the contents of her pocket spilling onto the sidewalk. Roberta's eyes widened as the slender silver instrument bounced twice upon the cracked, uneven pavement, then rolled to a stop only a few inches away from the slasher's feet. </p><p> The man caught the hopeless yearning in her gaze and glanced downward. "Hah!" he laughed at the sight of Roberta's errant servo. Saliva sprayed from his mouth as he mocked her. "What were you planning to do, <i>fraulein?</i> Write Old Jack a nasty letter?" </p><p> "Hey, the pen is mightier than the sword, or the switchblade, or whatever," Roberta answered defiantly, yanking her hand free from the perforated pocket and assuming a defensive stance. "Or haven't you heard?" </p><p> Her glib response elicited an angry scowl from the knife-wielding German. His ruddy features took on a bestial appearance as he advanced on Roberta with premeditated slowness, waving his blade back and forth before her watchful eyes. The yellow radiance of a distant lamp glinted off the shining, sharpened metal. "You ought to be more afraid, harlot. You should scream, scream for your life!" </p><p> <i>Nothing doing,</i> Roberta resolved, guessing that the psycho probably got off on his victims' fear. Struggling to maintain a confident expression, she raised her hands before her, karate-style. "Watch who you're calling names, you cornball creep. Who do you think you are, Jack the Rip-Off?" <i>That was a good one,</i> she thought, the wisecrack bolstering her courage. <i>Too bad the gag's probably lost in translation...</i> </p><p> The German smirked, as though at a private joke of his own. "You have no idea who you're dealing with, you stupid trollop, but I'll slice the impertinence from your bones, bit by bloody bit!" He lunged at Roberta, stabbing at her wildly while growling like a rabid beast. A string of drool trailed down his chin while his blood-streaked eyes bugged from their sockets. "Die, harlot, die!" </p><p> If he expected Roberta to shriek or run away, he was to be severely disappointed. Six years of covert missions alongside Gary Seven, facing everything from radioactive mutants to cyborg zombies, had taught the twenty-four-year-old woman how to take care of herself. </p><p> As her assailant stabbed his knife at her belly, she pivoted to the left, dodging the thrust, while parrying the blow with her right arm. Then she used her left to block and trap Jack's own arm long enough for her to grab on to his knife hand and steer it away from her body. As the German snarled in frustration, Roberta pressed her left arm against his elbow, forcing him to the pavement with a flawless forearm takedown. Dropping her knee onto his hyperextended arm freed her left hand, allowing her to wrestle the knife from his grip. <i>Guess all those jujitsu classes finally paid off,</i> she thought triumphantly. </p><p> Jack suddenly found himself facedown upon the asphalt, unarmed and at her mercy. Her knee kept his arm pinned to the ground, while both hands held on to his captured arm. She could have broken the limb easily from this position, but settled for pulling back on it painfully. Twisting his head, the crazed German stared back over his shoulder at Roberta, blinking in confusion. Clearly, he had not anticipated that his attractive young prey would offer such stiff resistance, let alone refuse to be intimidated by his threats and vicious attacks. "How -- ?" he murmured, breathing heavily from his exertions. His spectacles dangled precipitously upon the tip of his nose. "Who -- ?" </p><p> "I am woman, hear me roar," she stated, apr�s Helen Reddy. Had that song been a hit in East Germany, too? Roberta wasn't sure, but she hoped that her twisted adversary had gotten the message. <i>That'll teach this lunatic to underestimate us liberated American chicks!</i> </p><p> A rustle from above caught their attention. Still sprawled upon the sidewalk, Jack looked upward, past Roberta. His jaw dropped at the sight of a man in a business suit rappelling down the front of the embassy. </p><p> <i>About time,</i> Roberta thought. </p><p> The bottom end of a black nylon cable struck the sidewalk only seconds before the man himself touched down on the pavement. A tall, slender individual in a conservative gray suit, he looked to be in his late thirties, with touches of gray streaking his neatly trimmed brown hair. Shrewd gray eyes coolly assessed the situation: Roberta's torn coat, the knife-wielding stranger on the ground. </p><p> "Trouble, Ms. Lincoln?" Gary Seven asked calmly, arching a nearly invisible, faint-brown eyebrow. As if his dramatic entrance were not incongruous enough, a sleek black cat was draped over his shoulders. A white collar studded with sparkling transparent gems glittered against the feline's glossy fur. </p><p> "You might say that," Roberta conceded. The cat squawked at her indignantly, as if criticizing the human female for her carelessness in attracting the likes of Old Jack. <i>And hello again to you, too,</i> Roberta thought peevishly, glaring back at her four-legged nemesis, who sprang from Seven's shoulders onto the pavement, looking grateful to be back on solid ground. <i>Mrraow,</i> the feline squawked once more. </p><p> "Quiet, Isis," Seven addressed the cat. "I'm sure this wasn't Ms. Lincoln's fault at all." </p><p> All of this was much too weird for the dumbfounded slasher; with a burst of unexpected strength, he threw Roberta off him and scrambled to his feet. Abandoning his knife, he darted away, eager to make a hasty exit. <i>No way!</i> Roberta thought angrily. <i>You're not getting away from me that easily.</i> Snatching up her servo from where it had fallen, she set the weapon on Subdue and fired at the fleeing bad guy. </p><p> Despite his frantic haste, Jack was still in range. Watching his scurrying figure slow down, then collapse onto Unter den Linden, Roberta started to take off toward the tranquilized maniac, only to feel Seven lay a restraining hand upon her shoulder. "Not now, Ms. Lincoln," he advised. "We have no time for this." </p><p> "But -- ?" she blurted. The man was a menace to women everywhere. She couldn't just let him off with a warning. </p><p> "Leave him to the local authorities," Seven instructed firmly, no doubt anticipating her outraged arguments. </p><p> As if to prove his point, a shrill whistle suddenly blared from the vicinity of the gate. <i>"Achtung!"</i> a harsh voice cried out, followed by the sound of boots pounding on asphalt. "Put your hands up and stay where you are!" </p><p> <i>Oh, no!</i> Roberta realized that her altercation with Jack had finally drawn the attention of the border guards. Lights came on in the previously darkened windows of the embassy. Voices inside shouted in Russian, even as an enormous searchlight, mounted atop a sentry tower just before the Brandenburg Gate, swung in their direction, exposing all three of them -- Roberta, Seven, and Isis -- to a blinding glare that lit up the entire block. The spotlight stretched the trio's shadows out like taffy behind them. </p><p> "This way," Seven instructed. Leaving his rappelling gear behind, he scooped up Isis and began running up the boulevard, away from the onrushing soldiers. Deciding that maybe Old Jack had hit on the right idea after all, Roberta needed no further urging to sprint after Seven, servo in hand. </p><p> "Halt!" she heard someone yell less...</p></p><h2>The Franchise</h2><p>A story of professional football as a sport and as a business that details the lives of quarterback Taylor Rusk and his teammates on the Texas Pistols</p><p></p><h2>Architect Academy: Are You Ready for the Challenge?</h2><p>Discover the essential skills required on the way to becoming an architect in this innovative activity book.

Few places in England are more resonant, more mysterious, yet more friendly than the huge forest that lies by England's southern coast, that provided hunting for England's Saxon and Norman kings, whose ancient oaks were used to build Nelson's navy. Jane Austen and her family lived just twenty-five miles northeast of the forest. The river Avon runs down the forest's western edge. On its eastern side is the ancient Saxon capital of Winchester, the great port of Southampton from which the Titanic set out and the QE2 sails to, and beyond that Portsmouth, home of the British Navy.<br><br>It is against this rich backdrop that Rutherfurd tells a tale of woodsmen, monks, sailors, craftswomen and families. The largest family in the novel is modeled loosely upon the extended family of Jane Austen, together with certain other known families from the New Forest area. And so, we have the magical formula of previous Rutherford novels with the same sense of the passing of centuries but a shorter time period allowing for more character development and drama, culminating in the Austen period, a favorite in British history, just at the time when the New Forest was at its most bustling.</p><p>With such novels as <i>Sarum</i> and <i>Russka</i>, Edward Rutherfurd has laid claim to James Michener's longtime turf: the immensely researched, meticulously detailed epic of <i>place</i>, in which the characters tend to play second fiddle to the setting. <i>The Forest</i> is the most ambitious example yet of Rutherfurd's art. This time the location is that bosky patch of English real estate known as the New Forest. Other writers have tackled the area before. But <i>The Forest</i> is surely the definitive chronicle, with all the local stories, legends, and apocrypha woven into an irresistible narrative--think of Thomas Hardy's power and drama filtered through a very modern sensibility.<p> Opening with the assassination of King William II in 1099, the book covers nearly a millennium's worth of history. Rutherfurd creates generation after generation of adroitly realized characters, the best of whom defy our generic expectations: the canny Brother Adam, for example, is that rarest of literary creatures, a virtuous man who doesn't end up being simply bland and anodyne. Rutherfurd may be at his best when dealing with big-canvas events like the bloody Monmouth Rebellion of 1685. But he's no slouch at detailing more microcosmic conflicts, like this head-butting contest between two buck deer: </p><blockquote> Her buck had hit firmer ground and his feet suddenly got a purchase on the grass. His hindquarters shivering, he dug in. She saw the shoulders rise and his neck bear down. And now the interloper was slipping on the wet leaves. Slowly, cautiously, their antlers locked, the two straining bucks began to turn. Now they were both on grass. Suddenly the interloper disengaged. He gave his head a twist. The jagged spike was aiming at the buck's eye. </blockquote> Bestial behavior? Perhaps. Yet the level of human folly and brutality scattered throughout <i>The Forest</i> makes the foregoing passage resemble an outtake from <i>Bambi</i>--and gives this sylvan saga a very memorable edge. <i>--Barry Forshaw</i>&#x201c;Not all good things come in small packages. If you like books that are big, Edward Rutherfurd is your man. He writes wonderful sagas, tales that cover centuries, always keeping these long stories lively by telling us about the events and conflicts of people&#x2019;s lives. Rutherfurd does the painstaking research; the reader has all the fun.&#x201d;<br><i>&#x2013;Seattle Times<br></i><br>&#x201c;Many of the most memorable characters are women&#x2013;Adela the Norman, bold in the face of injustice; her descendant Alice Albion, almost brave enough to defeat the hatred of the civil war; tough old Adelaide, so loyal to ancient grievances that she can&#x2019;t let her sweet niece Fanny take hold of love.&#x201d;<br><i>&#x2013;Kansas City Star<br></i><br> &#x201c;The novel covers 10 centuries, tracking a half-dozen or so families and their fates, their fortunes, and intrigues moving the stories along. But the trees have tales to tell, too. As fiction, it works like a charm. . . . English majors will love this, and so will almost anyone else who starts page 1 and follows Puckle, Godwin Pride, Cola the Huntsman and their descendents along Rutherfurd&#x2019;s twisting road.&#x201d;<br><i>&#x2013;New York Daily News<br></i></p><h2>Kiln-Formed Glass: Over 25 Projects for Fused and Slumped Designs</h2><p>This enticing new book brings the magical qualities of luminous, color-rich glass to a wider audience.

According to world-renowned researcher Stuart Shanker, even the most frustrating, annoying or troubling behaviour has an explanation. That means there is a way to make things better.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Shanker's research has shown that for every child and every adult the ability to thrive--to complete tasks, form friendships, learn, and even love--depends on being able to self-regulate. In the past twenty years neurobiological research has been showing us a lot about brain states, and what is clear now is that the ability to self-regulate in response to stress is central. <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There are dramatic consequences to looking at a child's behaviour through the lens of self-regulation. Above all it discards the knee-jerk reaction that a child who is having trouble paying attention, controlling his impulses, or who gives up easily on a difficult task, is somehow weak or lacks self-discipline or is not making a great enough effort to apply himself. <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; According to Shanker, the ability to deal effectively with stress is limited, though. Like a tank of gas, our energy reserves eventually dwindle, leaving a kid--or an adult--simply unable to control his or her impulses. That is, misbehaving kids aren't choosing to be difficult. They literally can't help themselves. And what draws down our reserves? Excessive stress. Stress of all kinds, from social anxiety to an uncomfortable chair. Reduce the stress loads, and problems quickly dissipate.</p><p>Dr. Stuart Shanker is a distinguished research professor emeritus of philosophy and psychology&nbsp;at York University in Toronto and creator of The MEHRIT Centre, which is working with school boards across Canada to implement Self-Reg in teacher and parent education. He was educated at the University of Toronto, where he won several awards, including scholarships to study at Oxford, where he obtained his doctorate. He lives in Ontario.<br><br>Teresa H. Barker is a journalist and nonfiction book co-writer in the fields of child development and parenting, education, psychology, spirituality, health and aging.&#x201c;Though this book takes children&#x2019;s needs as its focus, it is really focused on providing guidance&#x2014;and even a degree of consolation&#x2014;to adults as they navigate the often tricky parent-child relationship. Shanker gives readers clear explanations of even the more complex neurological information, such as the role of the limbic system, as well as ample diagrams. And the discussion does not stop at the early childhood stage, moving ultimately into adolescence. If the stressed populations most in need of this book&#x2019;s lessons can find the time to read it, they will appreciate its potential to bring the minds of both parent and child to a state of heightened attentiveness with minimal anxiety.&#x201d;&#x2014; <i>Publishers Weekly</i></p><h2>Mirror, Mirror: A Social History of Fashion</h2><p>Trends in men&#39;s and women&#39;s fashions from the beginnings of human history to the 1970s are examined against the backdrop of changing social values and sexual mores</p><p></p><h2>RAISE THE TITANIC (Dirk Pitt Adventure)</h2><p><p> The President's secret task force develops the ultimate defensive weapon.

The government, already on edge from political and economic issues, used scare tactics, misinformation, and bullying to insure that parents sent their children to government &#x201c;rehabilitation&#x201d; camps. Ruby was placed in Camp Thurmond at the age of 10. Once there, the youths with special powers were punished, not rehabilitated. At 16, she is liberated by the Children's League, but they, too, want to control her, and she breaks from them to join fellow escapees Liam, Chubs, and Zu. They are determined to find the Slip Kid, who is rumored to help kids reunite with their families. This ragtag foursome outfits themselves at an abandoned Walmart, fights off unfriendly youth &#x201c;tribes,&#x201d; and begins to forge bonds of trust and romance. Ruby makes a thoughtful sacrifice, for the good of those she loves in the final chapters of the book (Hyperion, 2012), the first in a trilogy. Narrator Amy McFadden grows more comfortable with the voices as the title progresses, adding more nuance, particularly to major characters, and the proper note of teenage sarcasm. This dystopian tale will attract fans of Scott Westerfeld's &#x201c;Uglies&#x201d; (Simon Pulse) and Lauren Oliver's &#x201c;Delirium&#x201d; series (HarperCollins).&#x2013;Maggie Knapp, Trinity Valley School, Fort Worth, TX&#x3b1;(c) Copyright 2013.

Adler was born in New York City, New York. He graduated from Queens College in 1968 with a bachelor&#39;s degree in economics and education. For the next nine years, he worked as a mathematics teacher for the New York City Board of Education, while taking classes towards a master&#39;s degree in marketing, a degree he was awarded by New York University in 1971. In that same year, a question from his then-three-year-old nephew inspired Adler to write his first story, A Little at a Time, subsequently published by Random House in 1976. Adler&#39;s next project, a series of math books, drew on his experience as a math teacher. In 1977, he created his most famous character, Cam Jansen, originally featured in Cam Jansen and the Mystery of the Stolen Diamonds, which was published that year. Adler married psychologist Renee Hamada in 1973, and their first child, Michael, was born in 1977. By that time Adler had taken a break from teaching and, while his wife continued her work, he stayed home, took care of Michael, and began a full-time writing career. Adler has three children and one grandson. He lives in Woodmere, New York.Grade 2-4?The young daughter of German-Jewish refugees must be given into hiding when the Nazis invade Holland and persecution of the Jews escalates. The child forms deep attachments to her hosts, a Christian farm family, especially to their eldest daughter. When her parents come for her after the war, she refuses to leave and a difficult adjustment period ensues that has emotional ramifications for the family into the future. Adler has effectively related a story often recounted in adult memoirs and other nonfiction accounts about rescuers in the resistance movements during World War II. The necessity of using brief sentences and the limitation on the number of pages makes it difficult to impart a true sense of the trauma suffered by parents and children, although Adler does try and several, although not all, of Ritz's painterly watercolors add to the emotional impact. This is an important book to introduce the Holocaust in Holland and the heroic role of the Dutch Resistance in rescuing Jews and others in danger through hiding. Shulamith Oppenheim's The Lily Cupboard (HarperCollins, 1995) is a fictional treatment of a similar story, but it is much simpler.?Marcia W.

It&#39;s a collection of Chatwin gems--profiles, essays, and travel stories that span the world, from trekking in Nepal and sailing down the Volga to working on a film with Werner Herzog in Ghana and traveling with Indira Gandhi in India. Chatwin excels, as usual, in the finely honed tale.Bruce Chatwin was born in Sheffield in 1940. After attending Marlborough School he began work as a porter at Sotheby&#39;s. Eight years later, having become one of Sotheby&#39;s youngest directors, he abandoned his job to pursue his passion for world travel. Between 1972 and 1975 he worked for the Sunday Times, before announcing his next departure in a telegram: &#39;Gone to Patagonia for six months.&#39; This trip inspired the first of Chatwin&#39;s books, In Patagonia, which won the Hawthornden Prize and the E.M. Forster Award and launched his writing career. Two of his books have been made into feature films: The Viceroy of Ouidah (retitled Cobra Verde), directed by Werner Herzog, and Andrew Grieve&#39;s On the Black Hill. On publication The Songlines went straight to Number 1 in the Sunday Times bestseller list and remained in the top ten for nine months. On the Black Hill won the Whitbread First Novel Award while his novel Utz was nominated for the 1988 Booker Prize.

Using deeply annotated critical games from international practice, GM Sergey Shipov traces the Hedgehog&#39;s development - from its origins as a way to avoid well-trodden paths to its current status as a respected weapon in Black&#39;s armory. The Hedgehog has been adopted by the likes of Tal, Larsen, Adams, Kasparov, Kamsky, and Karpov. Drawing on decades of experience playing this defense, Shipov has put together much more than a simple opening manual full of variations. The author meticulously explains strategic themes, typical formations, move-order subtleties, and explores the thorny question: Is the Hedgehog a theoretically sound opening - and does that really matter? Along the way, the reader gets to see the mind of a grandmaster hard at work, and is treated to a lesson on one of the most important skills in chess: how to evaluate a position. Shipov shares his approach to chess and life, and his passion for both, in this entertaining, philosophical, and highly readable work.</p><p>Garry Kasparov spent twenty years as the world s #1 ranked chess player. In 2005, he retired from professional chess to lead the pro-democracy opposition against Vladimir Putin, from street protests to coalition building. In 2012, he was named chairman of the Human Rights Foundation, succeeding Vaclav Havel. He has been a contributing editor to the Wall Street Journal since 1991 and is a senior visiting fellow at the Oxford Martin School. His 2007 book, How Life Imitates Chess, has been published in twenty-six languages. He lives in self-imposed exile in New York with his wife Dasha and their children.</p><h2>American Musicians: Fifty-six Portraits in Jazz</h2><p>This is Whitney Balliett's long-awaited "big book." In it are all the jazz profiles he has written for <em>The New Yorker</em> during the past 24 years. These include his famous early portraits of Pee Wee Russell, Red Allen, Earl Hines, and Mary Lou Williams, done when these giants were in full flower; his recent reconstructions of the lives of such legends as Art Tatum, Coleman Hawkins, Jack Teagarden, Zoot Sims, and Dave Tough; His quick but indelible glimpses into the daily (or nocturnal) lives of Duke Ellington and Charles Mingus; and his vivid pictures of such on-the-scene masters as Red Norvo, Ornette Coleman, Buddy Rich, Elvin Jones, Art Farmer, Michael Moore, and Tommy Flanagan. Also included are such lesser known but invaluable players as Art Hodes, Jabbo Smith, Joe Wilder, Warne Marsh, Gene Bertoncini, Joe Bushkin, and Marie Marcus.<br> All these profiles make the reader feel, as one observer has pointed out, that he is "sitting with Balliett and his subject and listening in." The book can be taken as a kind of history of jazz, as well as a biographical encylopedia of many of its most important performers. It can also be regarded as a model of American prose. Robert Dawidoff said of Whitney Balliett"s most recent book, <em>Jelly Roll, Jabbo and Fats</em>, that "few people write as well about anything as Balliett writes about jazz." And the late Philip Larkin wrote in 1982 of the "transcendence of Balliett's prose."</p><p><br><em>About the Author:</em><br> Whitney Balliett has been jazz critic of <em>The New Yorker</em> since 1957.<br>"A sort of highly personal encyclopedia," Balliett calls this collection of sketches representing 25 years of his work for the New Yorker. His subjects include Duke Ellington, Doc Cheatham, Marian McPartland, and Cecil Taylor in a selection that spans the history and styles of jazz. Interviews form the core of most of the pieces: Balliett sets the scene, then lets each subject tell his or her own story. When he does step in to recount a performance, it is in a vivid and concise prose that creates a physical as well as a melodic presence. Balliett's previous collection, Jelly Roll, Jabbo, and Fats ( LJ 3/1/83) offered only a sample of his work. In its broad range of incisive but always appreciative portrayals, American Musicians stands as a showpiece for his talent. William Brockman, Drew Univ.

There seems to be a tradition of Florida noir that is as loony as that name implies. Tim Dorsey is the newest writer from the Sunshine State whose stories are inhabited by a cast of characters who, in any other state, would probably be behind bars. In Dorsey's world, not only are they roaming free, they are also wreaking havoc with impunity up and down the peninsula. <p> In his first book, <i>Florida Roadkill</i>, Dorsey introduced us to several characters who are still at large as his second story begins. Serge A. Storms is a spree killer and Florida history buff, still looking for the five million dollars that's stashed in the trunk of a Chrysler--unbeknownst to the driver--somewhere in the state. Johnny Vegas is a playboy who, because catastrophic events always seem to get in the way, has yet to lose his virginity. Also along for the zany ride is 90-year-old Mrs. Edna Ploomfield, who blows away a man delivering her flowers and chocolates; a DJ who changed his name legally to Boris the Hateful Piece of BLEEP so that he would not be BLEEPED on the air every time he used the name; and Safety Officer Chester "Porkchop" Dole who watches the monitors on the Sunshine Skyway Bridge. Along with a dancing Chihuahua who forecasts the weather, the Diaz Boys, Harvey Fiddlebottom, undercover cops, and a variety of oddballs, they will congregate in or around the seediest place never to have been shut down, the Hammerhead Ranch Motel on the Gulf of Mexico. There, they will play out their lunacy as Hurricane Rolando-berto bears down on them.

In Part One she surveys the historical antecedents of the method from ancient times to the postmodern era: classical rhetoric, literary critical theory, literary study of the Bible, and form criticism. Trible then presents samples of rhetorical analysis as the art of composition and as the art of persuasion. In Part Two, formulated guidelines are applied to a detailed study of the book of Jonah. A close reading with respect to structure, syntax, style, and substance elicits a host of meanings embedded in text, enabling the relationship between artistry and theology to emerge with clarity. Rhetorical Criticism has many distinctive features. It is the first comprehensive treatment of biblical rhetorical criticism as it has emerged within the latter half of the twentieth century. a didactic treatise that combines theoretical discussion, practical guidelines, and detailed exegesis interdisciplinary in approach, engaging the rhetorical study of the Bible with expanding developments in secular literary criticism (structuralism, poetics, reader-response criticism, and deconstruction, for example) and in the similarly burgeoning field of contemporary rhetoric itself a model of the rhetorical analysis that it describes accessible both to the novice and to the scholar</p><p>Phyllis Trible is Baldwin Professor Emerita of Sacred Literature at Union Theological Seminary in New York City.

Former Goldman Sachs Vice President Lisa Endlich draws on an insider's knowledge and access to all levels of management to bring to life this unique company that has long mystified financial players and pundits.<br><br>The firm's spectacular ascent is traced in the context of its tenacious grip on its core values. Endlich shows how close client contact, teamwork, focus on long-term profitability rather than short-term opportunism, and the ability to recruit consistently some of the most talented people on Wall Street helped the firm generate a phenomenal $3 billion in pretax profits in 1997. And she describes in detail the monumental events of 1998 that shook Goldman Sachs and the financial world.<br><br>Her book documents some of the most stunning accomplishments in modern American finance, as told through the careers of the gifted and insightful men who have led Goldman Sachs. It begins with Marcus Goldman, a German immigrant who in 1869 founded the firm in a lower Manhattan basement. After the turn of the century, we see his son Henry and his son-in-law Sam Sachs develop a full-service bank. <br><br>Sidney Weinberg, a kid from the streets, was initially hired as an assistant porter and became senior partner in 1930. We watch him as he steers the firm through the aftermath of the Crash and raises the Goldman Sachs name to national prominence. When he leaves in 1969 the firm has a solid-gold reputation and a first-class list of clients. We see his successor, Gus Levy, a trading wizard and in his day the best-known man on Wall Street, urging greater risk, inventing block trading (which revolutionized the exchanges), and psychologically preparing Goldman Sachs for the complex and perilous financial world that was the 1980s.<br><br>Endlich shows us how co-CEOs John Whitehead and John Weinberg turned the family firm into a highly professional international organization with a culture that was the envy of Wall Street. She shows as well how Steve Friedman and Robert Rubin brought the firm to the pinnacle of investment banking, increased annual profits from $900 million to $2.7 billion, and achieved dominance in most of the businesses in which the firm competes internationally. We see how Goldman Sachs weathered both an insider trading scandal and the fallout from its relationship with Robert Maxwell.<br><br>We are taken to the present day, as Jon Corzine and Hank Paulson lead the firm out of turmoil to face the most important decision ever placed before the partnership--the question of a public sale. For many years the leadership wrestled with the issue behind closed doors. Now, against the backdrop of unforeseen events, we witness the passionate debate that engulfed the entire partnership. <br><br>A rare and revealing look inside a great institution--the last private partnership on Wall Street--and inside the financial world at its highest levels.</p><p><i>Goldman Sachs</i> brings you inside the rarefied boardrooms of one of the most secretive Wall Street banking giants. Begun by a German immigrant in the late 1800s as a small family-run business, Goldman Sachs rose to become the world's top investment bank in the 1990s, even without selling stock to the public. It attracted some of the best talent in the business and cultivated an image of superiority and exclusivity. "The Goldman Sachs mystique was born of secrecy and success. Nothing like it exists on Wall Street," writes the author, Lisa Endlich, a former vice president at the firm. But behind that mystique lie tales of being swindled by British media tycoon Robert Maxwell, multimillion-dollar losses on bad trades, and the on-again, off-again attempts to go public. The book begins and ends with the firm's efforts to go public and get greater access to capital. Most other brokerages are already publicly traded, but internecine conflict and financial turmoil always seem to prevent Goldman from joining the action. In September 1998, for instance, Goldman stunned investors when it dropped plans for a stock offering amid a plunge in the market. A management shakeup soon followed. <i>Goldman Sachs</i> is an intriguing history of the company that invented such financial tools as block trading, commercial paper, and risk arbitrage. The book can sometimes be critical, but is largely a favorable portrait by a former employee. <i>--Dan Ring</i>"An engrossing, literate, and fair-minded study of America's premier investment house...Endlich is intelligent, insightful, and sensitive to the issues involved. And she was there...An excellent book."--E.

From the theatres of Broadway to the lobby of the Algonquin Hotel to tables at the Stork Club, intelligence and wit were the twinned coins of the realm. Alexander Woolcott, Irving Berlin, Edna Ferber, Arturo Toscanini, Leonard Bernstein, Cole Porter, Dorothy Parker, Truman Capote, the Lunts and Helen Hayes presided over the town. Their books, plays, performances, speeches, dinner parties, masked balls, loves, hates, likes and dislikes became the aspirations of a nation. If you wanted to be sophisticated, you played by Manhattan&#x2019;s rules. If you didn&#x2019;t, you simply weren&#x2019;t on the guest list. The Heartland rebelled against Manhattan&#x2019;s dictum, but never prevailed. In this lively cultural history, Mordden chronicles the city&#x2019;s most powerful and influential era.</p><p>ETHAN MORDDEN is the author of dozens of books, both fiction and nonfiction. His writing has appeared in <i>The New York Times, The New Yorker </i>and numerous other magazines and journals. He lives in Manhattan.1<br>Grand Hotel: The Round Table<br>The revolution collected its poster children in yet another hotel, the Algonquin, just a few months after Cole Porter claimed his cozy little corner in the Ritz. Here, at 59 West Forty-fourth Street, in Frank Case's twelve-story inn of special appeal to the performing arts and literary worlds, one gazed upon a clutch of truly familyless celebrities.<br>Some were the offspring of people only recently settled in America after emigration from unglamorous parts of Europe. Others came from geo graphical footnotes in the midwest or a city like Pittsburgh. One was even raised on a commune modeled on the Fourier phalange. Imagine the child of such eerie utopia mixing with the Astors! But the revolution thought nothing of it; if anything, it flavored one's r�sum� positively. It was only old Society that feared novelty.<br>None of the these newcomers to the great world had any money to speak of or was ever likely to&#x2014; not in the way Society understood money. As Mrs. Stuyvesant Fish put it, &#x201c;We are only moderately well off &#x201d;: because the Fishes had no more than &#x201c;a few million dollars.&#x201d; Nor did this new group assemble in places thought elite&#x2014;in the opera box or at Grace Church. Instead, the Algonquinites were theatregoers&#x2014;especially on first nights, because many of them were theatre critics or knew a few&#x2014;and essentially heathen. While society's leaders sought prominence within their set but anonymity elsewhere, the Algonquinites wanted to make their names, magnify them. The core group were all writers, but over the decade or so of its existence the Algonquin Round Table hosted actors, publishers, musicians, publicists, and sidekicks of various kinds. Achievers and the friends of achievers were welcome. Those whose achievement consisted in having great- great- grandfathers were not.<br>The whole thing got started by accident, in late 1919 or early 1920,* at a celebratory lunch more or less devoted to Alexander Woollcott. There were speeches, toasts, and insults both teasing and cutting, and everyone had a wonderful time. Someone said, &#x201c;Why don't we do this every day?,&#x201d; and they began to, meeting in the Algonquin's main dining hall at a long table, with side tables attending as needed. Then, sensing an angle for publicity, manager Case moved the gang to the smaller Rose Room, seating them at a round table right in the center of every other diner's view. Some of the Round Table came often and some now and again, with wives, friends, or new talent ready to be Introduced and take the town. The also theres included actress beauties Margalo Gillmore, Peggy Wood, and Ina Claire; playwrights Robert E. Sherwood, Laurence Stallings, and Marc Connelly; novelist Edna Ferber; and comic Harpo Marx. But the Round Table proper counted a sextet:<br>ALEXANDER WOOLLCOTT, overbearing merrymaker. Best assault on Wooll cott, by Gertrude Stein, who keeps interrupting: Woollcott: &#x201c;People don't dispute Woollcott.&#x201d; Stein: &#x201c;I'm not people. I'm Gertrude Stein.&#x201d;<br>ROBERT BENCHLEY, spokesman for the Little Fellow Eternally Puzzled By Life. Characteristic observation: &#x201c;I seem to be behind on my parades ...&#x201d;<br>DOROTHY PARKER, wit, lover, and occasional failed suicide. Essential first line of a Parker short story: &#x201c;Please, God, let him telephone me now.&#x201d;<br>*The date of the first lunch is unknown; writers treating the Round Table blithely skate around it.<br>GEORGE S. KAUFMAN, the fastest draw in the east in sarcasm. Typical un- Algonquinlike gallantry, in a curtain speech at the first night of Once in a Lifetime, a collaboration: &#x201c;I would like the audience to know that eighty percent of this play is Moss Hart.&#x201d;<br>FRANKLIN P. ADAMS, the mentor, already famous in his late thirties when the others were more or less starting out. Another assault on Woollcott, who toys with one of his own books and sighs, &#x201c;Ah, what is so rare as a Woollcott first edition?&#x201d; Adams: &#x201c;A Woollcott second edition.&#x201d;<br>and HEYWOOD BROUN, the one no one remembers anything about.Typical Broun line: &#x201c;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.&#x201d;<br>Socially breakaway to the point of mania, the Algonquinites first of all registered their importance for not only their work but their lives. Gossip was no longer relegated to Town Topics and the like; gossip was becoming news, even history. Some of the Algonquinites are read little if at all today, yet they remain famous for their eccentricities, and for doing things that writers don't normally do. A highly theatrical bunch, they actually put on a one-night-only revue called No Sirree! (1922) at a Broadway house, the Forty-Ninth Street Theatre. They took over on a Sunday evening, when the regular tenant, the Russian potpourri Chauve- Souris, wasn't playing. Some 750 guests and their guests&#x2014; no critics were asked&#x2014;sat through the usual revue of spoofs and specialties, but what a cast! The opening chorus was sung by Woollcott, Benchley, Kaufman, Adams, Connelly, and John Peter Toohey. There was a goof on a recent Theatre Guild offering, Andryeyef's He Who Gets Slapped, as &#x201c;He Who Gets Flapped.&#x201d; He was the six-foot-seven-inch Robert E. Sherwood in straw hat and cane, dwarfing a line of flappers in gingham that included Helen Hayes and Tallulah Bankhead; the girls sang lyrics by Dorothy Parker. Benchley created a comic classic in his bumbling &#x201c;Treasurer's Report.&#x201d; (&#x201c;Mr. Rossiter, unfortunately our treasurer&#x2014;or rather Mr. Rossiter, our treasurer, unfortunately is confined at his home tonight... .&#x201d;) Opera baritone Reinald Werrenrath sang &#x201c;Johnny Weaver,&#x201d; on writer John Van Alstyne Weaver, the Algonquin's resident Extremely Cute Boy and later Peggy Wood's husband. A. A. Milne's play Mr. Pim Passes By got the &#x201c;Down with British Whimsey!&#x201d; treatment. And, in a bow to Ziegfeld, Beatrice Herford took the next- to-closing* as &#x201c;The Algonquin Girl.&#x201d;<br>Staged as &#x201c;An anonymous entertainment by the Vicious Circle of the Hotel Algonquin,&#x201d; No Sirree! led to a full- fledged Broadway production, The &#x2019;49ers, this time with sets, salaries, and critics. But it was still an amateur night, however full of personality. The non- participating Woollcott, who hated it, likened it to &#x201c;a dinner consisting of five courses of perfectly splendid lemon meringue pie.&#x201d;<br>The &#x2019;49ers bombed. Yet it is worth observing that, of its cast, Kaufman, Connelly, and Benchley all distinguished themselves later as performers on Broadway, as did Woollcott as well. The Algonquinites were showoffs, trading in eccentricity in life as well as in work, like actors who never quite made it to the wings.<br>For instance, wasn't Benchley always &#x201c;on,&#x201d; always that bumbling treasurer? The word for him is &#x201c;mild&#x201d;; but it's the only word. It was probably Benchley more than anyone else who infused The New Yorker magazine, in its early years, with that zealotry of the trivial that has haunted its reputation ever since&#x2014;that feeling that its writers seemed unaware of global cataclysm but fell to pieces when they had to change a typewriter ribbon. For Vanity Fair, the old Life, and The New Yorker, Benchley would prosper in the &#x201c;casual,&#x201d; on problems with shoelaces or taxis or &#x201c;Your Boy and His Dog.&#x201d; These pieces cannot even be called frivolous, because they lack the focus that, say, No�l Coward could bring to rhapsodizing about silly things. Benchley's pieces are curlicues of smoke, a way of writing without saying anything.<br>*The penultimate offering on a vaudeville bill, invariably taken by the top headliner or, on the small-town circuits, the least terrible act available. The last offering was known as The Chaser&#x2014;something grisly, to &#x201c;chase&#x201d; the public out of the house, freeing seats for the next show. The next-to-closing survives in the concept of musical comedy's Eleven O'Clock Song, an exhibition piece before the last scene, reserved for the star. In old- fashioned shows it tends to the extraneous, such as Bells Are Ringing's &#x201c;I'm Going Back&#x201d; or, when two stars share the spotlight, DuBarry Was a Lady's &#x201c;Friendship.&#x201d; The reconstructed musical absorbs the convention more thematically, as in Gypsy's &#x201c;Rose's Turn.&#x201d;<br>Benchley in person made the whole act charming all the same. Coward's art is brittle because it's a pose; Benchley isn't faking. Nor is his good friend Dorothy Parker, whose act was Miss Helpless, always short of the carfare home. Taxis seemed to bring out extremes in this set: George S. Kaufman, who made his act out of being imperturbable even when most biting, would become choleric in his dealings with cab drivers.<br>Yet Kaufman handled anyone else with ease, maintaining the smoothest irony in the business. Out of town with the Hollywood spoof Merton of the Movies, co-written with Marc Connelly, Kaufman found his partner holding tight to a laugh line that got no laughs. Night after night, the line went dud as Connelly kept explaining how it couldn't miss stopping the show as the public roared in delight. &#x201c;There's only one thing we can do,&#x201d; Kaufman finally said. &#x201c;We've got to call the audience in tomorrow morning for a ten o'clock rehearsal.&#x201d;<br>Oddly, these newfangled Round Tablers with their disdain&#x2014; perhaps simply disregard&#x2014; for received values could be conservative in their own way. Franklin P. Adams&#x2019; famous newspaper column The Conning Tower actually anticipated the Internet blog in its printing of contributions from outsiders. Post comments here. Yet Adams himself wrote in an imitation of Samuel Pepys, complete with outdated syntax and bewigged observations. Also oddly, the Jewish Algonquinites were unbelievers yet married strictly within the parish. Further, when Kaufman and his wife, Beatrice, adopted a child, they applied to a Jewish organization for the baby. But if one has no use for the religion qua se, why make a point of expanding one's family under its jurisdiction?<br>The outstanding conservative in the pack&#x2014;and, if he had anything to say about it, its leader&#x2014; was Woollcott, a figure out of a vanished age. Not the nineteenth century but the tenth: a front-parlor pasha, accusing and tiffing, now cajoling his favorites and now consigning the disobedient to an oubliette. In small-town America, Woollcott would have been chased out of the barber shop by the real men, not because he resembled a big fat owl but because he was an angry queen avant le temps, sarcastically abusive of friends and enemies alike and as eager to boost a passion as demolish a peeve.<br>You've met him. He's Sheridan Whiteside, the man who came to dinner in the Kaufman and Hart play. Mind you, the authors didn't write a version of Woollcott. They wrote Woollcott: domineering yet easily hurt, not only manipulative but manipulating with evil relish, exploding one's direst vulnerabilities then pretending it was a harmless jest. After taking all this in, you notice that he is, after all, innovative in one area: there are no women in his life in the romantic sense. There are the Algonquin women, of course: to play games with and fill out the dinner table. Or perhaps simply to charm the other men.<br>Was he homosexual? He was certainly gay: in style. But did he go for men? A rumor about some childhood disease removing him from consideration as a begetter of children was the excuse fronting his bachelorhood. But did one need an excuse? This was the age of the mariage blanc. It was almost the rage. Many a show- biz couple mated without mating&#x2014;the Cole Porters, the Lunts, the Katharine Cornells. And everyone knew that, early on, the Kaufmans had stopped bundling in an open marriage without a thought of divorce. &#x201c;Beatrice is always picking up these sensitive, ambitious young Jews,&#x201d; Kaufman told Woollcott, who promptly replied, &#x201c;Sometimes she marries them.&#x201d;<br>So he's worldly, isn't he, our Woollcott? Infirmity was not likely the reason why he did not consort with women. He didn't, either, with men, though he seems to have had a very physical crush on Harpo Marx, who was not unappealing when out of his getup. Woollcott consorted, really, with himself: with his micromanaging of the getaway weekend, with his running commentary on croquet championships and poker marathons, with his grand entrance as drama critic, complete with swirling cape, Count Dracula first-nighting. And, above all, with his devotion to great traditions in the arts, the old masters or those who, like the Lunts, found new ways to make good old- fashioned theatre.<br>The only really new thing about Woollcott was his status as one of New York's first Famous Queens. Supplementary Algonquinites John V. A. Weaver and Peggy Wood married because they were young and beautiful and gifted. It was the kind of fairy tale that movies invent but untypical of the Algonquin circle and unavailable to Woollcott. His story was that of the Difficult Celebrity, an invention of the 1920s, of Manhattan, of the Algonquin. Here was a new format for the elite, because the Round Tablers were not only peculiar but insular and provincial&#x2014; not just New Yorkers but the essence of that address. Kaufman always said that he would travel only as far as would allow him to get &#x201c;back to Broadway and Forty-Fourth by midnight.&#x201d;<br>But then, the culture in general was becoming Manhattan-centric at this time. Except for cinema, the entertainment media were headquartered in New York&#x2014; popular music, for example. As a business, American song lived on Tin Pan Alley, the nickname for a block of Twenty-eighth Street where most of the music publishers auditioned and signed up new ware. The acculturation of radio in the 1920s and the arrival of the talkie at de cade's end produced, for the first time, a truly national music, vitalized by the arrival of the Gershwins, Rodgers and Hart, Cole Porter. Irving Berlin and Jerome Kern had turned up somewhat earlier, leading an evolution away from, say, &#x201c;Ta- Ra- Ra- Boom- De-Ay&#x201d; and toward something like &#x201c;Night and Day.&#x201d;<br>Thus, the first of the movies&#x2019; all-sound features with song&#x2014;the first Hollywood musical ever, released in early 1929&#x2014; is called The Broadway Melody. It opens with overhead footage of Manhattan's skyscrapers to the strains of the kind of music they're not going to write any more, Victor Herbert's &#x201c;The Streets of New York.&#x201d; We move thence to the Gleason Music Publishing Company, situated of course in Tin Pan Alley, and amid the cacaphony we listen for the next tune to define the age. Which will it be? A soprano tries out something on the dippy side, so that isn't it. Piano, guitar, and clarinet sample something hot for a men's singing trio, but the singing's just a little too trio. Or something. That isn't it. An ebullient sister act sways to a lively ballad&#x2014;but before we can collect it, Mr. Gleason himself appears in the main hallway. (This is in fact actor James Gleason in a small unbilled role, for Gleason is famous for his wise-guy attitudes, what they call a &#x201c;New York part.&#x201d;) Gleason's going to let our male lead, Charles King, plug a new one he calls &#x201c;The Broadway Melody.&#x201d; You only get one chance with these things, so King instructs the pianist, &#x201c;The second chorus&#x2014;a little jazz, a little pep, and everything. Ya know?&#x201d;<br>Now everyone crowds in to hear, and if the verse is restrained, the chorus immediately starts swinging. The instrumental trio from before sits in, winging it; one of the ebullient sisters, mesmerized, takes on the rhythm as if a second skin, moving within the sound. Even the dippy soprano gets with it. &#x201c;No skies of gray on the Great White Way!&#x201d; King exults, as the gang around him revels in the lates...</p><h2>All Star Superman Vol. 02 HC</h2><p>In this follow-up to the hit ALL STAR SUPERMAN VOL. 1, the Man of Steel goes toe-to-toe with Bizarro, his oddball twin, and the new character Zibarro, also from the Bizarro planet. And Superman faces the final revenge of Lex Luthor -- his own death!</p><p>Grant Morrison is one of comics&#39; greatest innovators. His long list of credits includes Batman: Arkham Asylum, JLA, Seven Soldiers, Animal Man, Doom Patrol, The Invisibles and The Filth. He is currently writing Batman and All-Star Superman Frank Quitely has won acclaim for his work on high-profile titles including We3, JLA: Earth 2, The Authority, and New X-Men.Morrison, Quitely and Grant conclude their fresh and compelling take on the most iconic superhero in comics. Recently, grittier modern-day reinterpretations of classic characters, set outside normal continuity, have become the popular way to do a limited series such as this one. Morrison's Superman, however, is the same defender of truth, justice and the American way recognizable to generations of comics readers. Now, however, his days are numbered. Slowly dying from overexposure to solar radiation, Superman is faced with the dilemma of how to do the most good in his final days and how to prepare the people and planet he loves to carry on without him. Morrison's feverish style is both a blessing and a curse, as the overwhelming deluge of ideas thrown at the reader confuses even while creating a parallel with Superman's own constant supersensory information overload. Yet Morrison's writing recaptures the sense of simple wonder and virtue essential to a classic Superman tale. Quitely and Grant's art is evocative of the earliest images of the character, a refined evolution of the bright costumes, skylines and chiseled jaws that adds a dignity and humanity to the characters beyond their cartoonish origins. <i>(Feb.)</i> <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

The music for the Little Office has never before been gathered together in one volume. For many people the Gregorian chant of the Little Office offers an introduction to the beauty of the Church's traditional liturgical heritage. This volume will help you sing all the Hours of the Little Office. <p> Our edition includes a commentary on the rubrics and ceremonial by 'A Master of Novices' (which was first published in the early twentieth century), and also includes a description of the indulgences with which the recitation of the Little Office has been enriched by Holy Mother Church. </p><p> The Little Office of the Blessed Virgin Mary is a shorter form of the Divine Office in honour of the Blessed Virgin Mary. It has long been the Church s daily liturgical prayer to Our Lady, and these hours of praise have been used by Priests, religious and the laity throughout the centuries. Lay people used to flock to the great Cathedrals to publicly recite The Little Office during the Middle Ages, and during the great persecution, when the practice of the Catholic Faith was illegal in Great Britain, Bishop Challoner commended The Little Office to his flock. </p><p> Through its psalms, antiphons, readings, responsorials, and prayers the Little Office stresses the role Our Lady played in salvation history, and how through her fiat the divine Word took flesh in her womb and achieved salvation for us all; and how Our Lord granted her the first fruits of the general resurrection in her holy and glorious assumption. </p><p> All Catholics are called to a consistent prayer life. For those who do not feel called to recite the Divine Office, but still wish to participate in the liturgical prayer of the Church, or for those who have a particular devotion to the holy Mother of God, there is no finer form of prayer than the Little Office of the Blessed Virgin Mary. </p><p> Features include:<br> - Based on an edition published just after the Reform Act in 1850 (allowing English Catholics to openly practice the Faith).<br> - English translation uses traditional language with scripture taken from Bishop Challoner's version of the Douay-Rheims Bible.<br> - Fully updated to comply with the editio typica of the Breviary (1961) permitted by the Holy Father's <i>Motu Proprio 'Summorum Pontificum'.</i><br> - The first ever edition to include the complete Gregorian chants for the Little Office.<br> - Meditations before each hour from the mediaeval Mirror of Our Lady.<br> - Preface by the Very Reverend Fr. Berg, superior of the FSSP.<br> - Latin-English, red and black text.<br> - Psalms from the Vulgate.<br> - Flexible leather cover with stitched edge, gold gilding, 2 ribbons.</p></p><p>The Little Office of the Blessed Virgin Mary from Baronius Press is a wonderful new printing of a tried and true classic which every Catholic should include in their library. Much more brief than the Divine Office, the Little Office in honor of Our Lady is a way for lay Catholics to join the universal Church in her daily prayers. Traditional Catholics will love the fact that this edition complies with the 1961 editio typica for the Immemorial Mass, using readings from the Douay-Rheims, Challoner version of the Holy Bible, with Psalms from the Vulgate of St. Jerome, and includes the full Latin text of each Office in addition to the vernacular. Furthermore, Catholics familiar with Gregorian notation can say each Office the same way as countless Saints through the ages- in beautiful Gregorian chant, since this edition uniquely contains the entire Gregorian chant of each Office. Beautifully bound and printed, with a soft, flexible leather cover and lightweight but sturdy gilded pages, with two ribbons, one blue and one gold, and an included card containing the conclusions of prayers in the Office, which can be used as a third bookmark, the Little Office of the Blessed Virgin Mary from Baronius Press features a classic Missal layout, in bold black and red text, with the English on left and Latin translation on the right. There are actually three books within- one set of Offices for each season, with Office 1 being used throughout the year, Office 2 used during Advent, and Office 3 used from first Vespers of the Nativity until the Feast of the Purification. Each Office also contains a section for Eastertide, so the faithful Catholic can celebrate with the Church all year long. Prefaced by the Very Reverend Father John Berg, Superior General of the Priestly Society of Saint Peter (FSSP), with a wonderful introduction by Theo Keller explaining the history of the Little Office, the book contains the Imprimatur of the Most Reverend Fabian W. Bruskewitz, DD, STD, Bishop of Lincoln. Besides all this, several appendices contain descriptions of prayers and liturgy, notes on the Office, rubrics, a calendar of feasts, list of indulgences for faithful recitation of the Office, litanies- all in a book which easily fits in a back pocket or purse. It is amazing how much was able to be included in this little two hundred twenty-seven page book! If prayed slowly and attentively, each Office takes about twenty minutes, or the same length of time as a Rosary. So there is no reason why every Catholic should not include the Little Office of the Blessed Virgin Mary as part of their daily prayers. --Joshua - from the website Tiberriver.com<br><br>We highly recommend this version of the book published by Baronius Press in English and Latin. There are other versions of a Little Office to Mary, but this is the one that we recommend and are using for direction. It has a leather cover and superior binding. It ships from the US for American customers. We derive no profit whatever from Baronius Press which simply publishes excellent quality Catholic books. --Boston Catholic Journal<br><br>If you buy a print copy of the Divine Office or a Little Office, make sure you find the most beautiful, traditional version you can. My mother wanted to pray the Divine Office, and she spent a LOT of money on a modern (current, vernacular) edition but she found the translations so weak and watery, and the intercessory prayers so wishy-washy that she was driven to give it up! She doesn t know Latin, though, so she didn t want to use a traditional Breviary and not understand a word of it. After she finally found the Little Office of the Blessed Virgin Mary she was very happy! It was just the thing: sacred and reverent, beautiful, and connected to centuries of tradition. (Baronius Press publishes one with readings and psalms from the Douay-Rheims translation of the Bible, which is just beautiful.) --St. Catherine Catholic Culture Center, March 2014<br><br>Recently I began praying again The Little Office of the Blessed Virgin Mary from Baronius Press. I purchased this about a year ago, I think, and was impressed with the quality of the product. It is a very compact, yet elegant prayer book. Having prayed the Liturgy of the Hours at various points over the past 7 years, this little office is in many ways refreshing. This edition is the 1961 edition, which follows the older organization of the hours, before the post-conciliar reforms. Although I am Novus Ordo guy, I must say that over the past week I have been really drawn to praying this office. Perhaps it is the simplicity of this little office or maybe the dual English-Latin prayers on the same page. I also like the almost 1000 year history and tradition that is a part of this office. I am planning to stick with this for the next few months. I have been able to pray most of the hours, except for the matins. Although I am sure there will be some late nights in the future with her, so that might change! ;) --Timothy McCormick, Catholic Bibles Blog, June 2011</p><h2>1415: Henry V&#39;s Year of Glory</h2><p>An epic account of King Henry V and the legendary Battle of Agincourt, from the author of the bestselling <i>Time Traveller's Guide to Medieval England</i>. <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Henry V is regarded as the great English hero. Lionised in his own lifetime for his victory at Agincourt, his piety and his rigorous application of justice, he was elevated by Shakespeare into a champion of English nationalism. But does he really deserve to be thought of as 'the greatest man who ever ruled England'?<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In Ian Mortimer's groundbreaking book, he portrays Henry in the pivotal year of his reign; recording the dramatic event of 1415, he offers the fullest, most precise and least romanticised view we have of Henry and of what he did. The result is not only a fascinating reappraisal of Henry; it brings to the fore many unpalatable truths which biographies and military historians have largely ignored. At the centre of the book is the campaign which culminated in the battle of Agincourt: a slaughter ground designed not to advance England's interest directly but to demonstrate God's approval of Henry's royal authority on both sides of the channel.<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1415 was a year of religious persecution, personal suffering and one horrendous battle. This is the story of that year, as seen over the shoulder of its most cold-hearted, most ambitious and most celebrated hero.</p><p>IAN MORTIMER has BA and PhD degrees in history from Exeter University and an MA in archive studies from University College London. He was elected a Fellow of the Royal Historical Society in 1998, and was awarded the Alexander Prize (2004) by the Royal Historical Society for his work on the social history of medicine. He is the author of three medieval biographies, <i>The Greatest Traitor: The Life of Sir Roger Mortimer</i>, <i>The Perfect King: The Life of Edward III</i>, and <i>The Fears of Henry IV: The Life of England's Self-Made King</i> as well as the bestselling <i>The Time Traveller's Guide to Medieval England</i>.

She lives in Oregon.CHAPTER 1 <br>DAY 1, 4:51 P.M. <br>&nbsp; <br>&nbsp; <br>I wake up. <br>But wake up isn&#x2019;t quite right. That implies sleeping. A bed. A pillow. <br>I come to. <br>Instead of a pillow, my right cheek is pressed against something hard, rough, and gritty. A worn wood floor. <br>My mouth tastes like old pennies. Blood. With my eyes still closed, I gently touch my teeth with my tongue. One of them feels loose. The inside of my mouth is shredded and sore. My head aches and there&#x2019;s a faint buzzing in one ear. <br>And something is wrong with my left hand. The tips of my pinkie and ring finger throb with every beat of my heart. The pain is sharp and red. <br>Two men are talking, their voices a low murmur. Something about no one coming for me. Something about it&#x2019;s too late. <br>I decide to keep my eyes closed. Not to move. I&#x2019;m not sure I could anyway. It&#x2019;s not only my tooth that feels wrong. <br>Footsteps move closer to me. A shoe kicks me in the ribs. Not very hard. More like a nudge. Still, I don&#x2019;t allow myself to react. Through slitted eyes, I see two pairs of men&#x2019;s shoes. One pair of brown boots and one pair of red-brown dress shoes that shade to black on the toes. A distant part of me thinks the color is called oxblood. <br>&#x201c;She doesn&#x2019;t know anything,&#x201d; a man says. He doesn&#x2019;t sound angry or even upset. It&#x2019;s a simple statement of fact. <br>I realize he&#x2019;s right. I don&#x2019;t know anything. What&#x2019;s wrong with me, where I am, who they are. And when I try to think about who I am, what I get is: nothing. A big gray hole. All I know for sure is that I must be in trouble. <br>&#x201c;I need to get back to Portland and follow our leads there,&#x201d; the other man says. &#x201c;You need to take care of things here. Take her out back and finish her off.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;But she&#x2019;s just a kid,&#x201d; the first man says. His tone is not quite so neutral now. <br>&#x201c;A kid?&#x201d; The second man&#x2019;s voice hardens. &#x201c;If she talks to the cops, she could get us both sent to death row. It&#x2019;s either her or us. It&#x2019;s that simple.&#x201d; His footsteps move away from me. &#x201c;Call me when you&#x2019;re done.&#x201d; <br>The other man nudges me with his foot again. A little harder this time. <br>Behind me, I hear a door open and close. <br>&#x201c;Come on. Get up.&#x201d; With a sigh, he leans over and grabs me under my arms. Grunting, he hauls me up from behind. His breath smells bitter, like coffee. I try to keep my body limp, but when my left hand brushes the floor, the pain in my fingers is an electric shock. My legs stiffen and he pulls me to my feet. <br>&#x201c;That&#x2019;s right,&#x201d; he says, nudging me forward while still holding me up. &#x201c;We&#x2019;re going to take a little walk.&#x201d; <br>Since he already knows that I&#x2019;m conscious, I figure I can open my eyes halfway. We&#x2019;re in what looks like a cabin, with knotty pine walls and a black wood-burning stove. Yellow stuffing spills from sliced cushions on an old plaid couch and a green high-backed chair. Books lie splayed below an emptied bookcase. Someone was obviously looking for something, but I don&#x2019;t know what, and I don&#x2019;t know if they found it. Past the red-and-white-checkered curtains lie nothing but fir trees. <br>With the guy&#x2019;s arm clamped around my shoulders, I stumble past a table with four wood chairs. One of them is turned away from the table. Ropes loosely encircle the arms. A pair of bloody pliers sits on the table next to what seems like two silver-white chips mostly painted pink. <br>I look down at my limp left hand. Pink polish on three of the nails. The tips of the last two fingers are wet and red where nails used to be. <br>I think I know where I was before I ended up on the floor. <br>I keep every step small and shuffling so that he&#x2019;s half carrying me. It&#x2019;s not easy because he&#x2019;s not much bigger than me, maybe five foot nine. The guy mutters under his breath, but that&#x2019;s all. Maybe he doesn&#x2019;t want to get to where we are going any more than I do. The back door is about twenty feet away. <br>Outside, a car starts up and then drives away. The only other sounds are the wind in the trees outside and the man grunting every now and then as he tries to make my body walk in a straight line. <br>Wherever we are, I think we&#x2019;re alone. It&#x2019;s just me and this guy. And once he manages to get me out the door, he&#x2019;ll follow instructions. <br>He&#x2019;ll finish me off. <br>Kill me. <br> <br> <br>&nbsp; <br>Text copyright � 2013 by April Henry <br></p><h2>The Oxford Companion to Crime and Mystery Writing</h2><p>From the penny dreadful, which challenges seekers of sensation to discover the truth in a pattern of gory details; to the twentieth-century detective novel, which offers an intricate puzzle solved through the application of the intellect; to the crime novel, which probes the psyches of the characters, the crime and mystery genre offers readers an intellectual excitement unsurpassed by other forms of fiction. Now <em>The Oxford Companion to Crime and Mystery Writing</em> provides scholars and fans of this genre with an authoritative yet playful compendium of knowledge about a literature known for its highly entertaining treatment of deadly serious puzzles.<br> Editor Rosemary Herbert has brought together 666 articles--written by such authorities as Edward D. Hoch, Sara Paretsky, and the late Julian Symons--that will accompany readers in their armchair investigations. Here can be found informative biographies of great mystery writers from Edgar Allan Poe to Rex Stout to Ruth Rendell. Here, too, favorite sleuths--including Sherlock Holmes, Hercule Poirot, Sam Spade, Nero Wolfe, Adam Dalgliesh, and Kinsey Milhone--keep company with master criminals such as Professor Moriarty and Fu Manchu. Character types--from the country constable to the omniscient sleuth to the femme fatale--sleuth, think, or slink within these pages.<br> In the great tradition of Oxford <em>Companions</em>, this volume features extended essays on the development of this literature, its subgenres and schools of writing. It also serves as a catalogue of the components of mystery writing, such as famous clues, authorial ingenuity, and even an entry on "The Butler Did It." A strength of the volume is found in linked articles which can guide readers from, for instance, a careful definition of Murder to a delightfully quirky compendium of fictional victims in an article on The Corpse.</p><p><b>Penzler Pick, April 2000:</b> Over the years, there have been quite a few reference books in the mystery genre arranged as dictionaries, encyclopedias, companions, and so on. (I coauthored two of them, so I know what goes into their production.) Rosemary Herbert's <i>Companion</i> differs from many others in at least two ways: first, she did not write it but rather edited the work of numerous well-known mystery scholars and academics, each of whom presumably has some expertise in the subjects they wrote about; and second, there are as many articles devoted to umbrella subjects (eccentrics, elderly sleuths, English village milieu, and escapism, to open the book at random) as to authors and characters. It is an interesting way to arrange a reference book and more fun to read than the potted author biographies in similar works, but it seems to be less useful as a reference tool than those works.<p> Inevitably, the first criticism leveled at such a work is the question of why certain authors or characters were included and others omitted. At random, I note entries for Inspector Hanaud, Joseph Hansen, and Cyril Hare, but none for James Crumley or Minette Walters. Perhaps this boils down to the subjective notion that it's more important to have entries for both A.E.W. Mason and his series character, Hanaud--seldom read nowadays--than for one of the half-dozen best hard-boiled writers alive and for the heir apparent to the thrones of Ruth Rendell and P.D. James. The problem is somewhat exacerbated by the subject articles, where one can look in vain under "stalking" for a mention of Mary Higgins Clark but instead find Evelyn E. Smith. The "missing persons" entry makes no mention of Hillary Waugh's superb <i>Last Seen Wearing</i> but does reference an obscure Mary Roberts Rinehart short story.</p><p> As I reread this page, it seems as if I don't like the book, which is certainly not true. This type of book begs for nitpicking, and that's what I've been doing. It is wonderfully written, on balance, and the overview articles are informative and a joy to read, often providing historical perspective that serves as an excellent guide for readers who want to embark on a journey through, say, the world of legal fiction or forensic pathology. <i>The Oxford Companion</i> shouldn't be your only reference book, but it should find a spot on every devotee's shelf. <i>--Otto Penzler</i></p><br><strong>Rosemary Herbert</strong> is the mystery book review columnist for <em>The Boston Herald</em>.

Over time, eight key technologies gradually freed us from the limitations of our animal origins.<br><br>The fabrication of weapons, the mastery of fire, and the technologies of clothing and shelter radically restructured the human body, enabling us to walk upright, shed our body hair, and migrate out of tropical Africa. Symbolic communication transformed human evolution from a slow biological process into a fast cultural process. The invention of agriculture revolutionized the relationship between humanity and the environment, and the technologies of interaction led to the birth of civilization. Precision machinery spawned the industrial revolution and the rise of nation-states; and in the next metamorphosis, digital technologies may well unite all of humanity for the benefit of future generations.<br><br>Synthesizing the findings of primatology, paleontology, archeology, history, and anthropology, Richard Currier reinterprets and retells the modern narrative of human evolution that began with the discovery of Lucy and other Australopithecus fossils. But the same forces that allowed us to integrate technology into every aspect of our daily lives have also brought us to the brink of planetary catastrophe. <i>Unbound</i> explains both how we got here and how human society must be transformed again to achieve a sustainable future.<br><br><b>Technology: The deliberate modification of any natural object or substance with forethought to achieve a specific end or to serve a specific purpose.&#x201d;</b></p><p><b>Richard L.

Most conservationists and environmentalists share this view. But what if the traditional view of ecology is wrong&#x2014;what if true environmentalists should be applauding the invaders? <br><br> In <i>The New Wild</i>, Pearce goes on a journey across six continents to rediscover what conservation in the twenty-first century should be about. Pearce explores ecosystems from remote Pacific islands to the United Kingdom, from San Francisco Bay to the Great Lakes, as he digs into questionable estimates of the cost of invader species and reveals the outdated intellectual sources of our ideas about the balance of nature. Pearce acknowledges that there are horror stories about alien species disrupting ecosystems, but most of the time, the tens of thousands of introduced species usually swiftly die out or settle down and become model eco-citizens. The case for keeping out alien species, he finds, looks increasingly flawed. <br><br> As Pearce argues, mainstream environmentalists are right that we need a rewilding of the earth, but they are wrong if they imagine that we can achieve that by reengineering ecosystems. Humans have changed the planet too much, and nature never goes backward. But a growing group of scientists is taking a fresh look at how species interact in the wild. According to these new ecologists, we should applaud the dynamism of alien species and the novel ecosystems they create. <br><br> In an era of climate change and widespread ecological damage, it is absolutely crucial that we find ways to help nature regenerate. Embracing the new ecology, Pearce shows us, is our best chance. To be an environmentalist in the twenty-first century means celebrating nature&#x2019;s wildness and capacity for change.</p><p><b>Fred Pearce</b> is an award-winning author and journalist based in London.

Nature&#x2019;s vagabonds, ruffians, and carpetbaggers are headed for an ecosystem near you. These biological adventurers are traveling the world in ever greater numbers, hitchhiking in our luggage, hidden in cargo holds, stuck to the bottom of ships, and migrating to keep up with climate change. Today&#x2019;s human-dominated world of globalized trade and messed-up ecosystems is giving footloose species many more chances to cruise the planet and set up home in distant lands. Some run riot, massacring local species, trashing their new habitats, and spreading diseases.</p><p>Most of us like a simple story with good guys and bad guys, and aliens always make easy enemies. So the threat of foreign species invading fragile environments and causing ecological mayhem gets our attention. Conservationists have for half a century been battling to hold back the tide of aliens. They call them the second biggest threat to nature, after habitat loss. Their concern is laudable. They want to protect native species and the ecosystems they inhabit. But do we fear these ecological outsiders too much? Most environmentalists would recoil to think this, but maybe our fear is sometimes little more than green xenophobia. Most of us are appalled when foreign humans are treated as somehow intrinsically dangerous. Yet the orthodoxy in conservation is to demonize foreign species in just that way. Native is good and alien is bad. But is this simple formula true? Or might we <i>need</i> the go-getter, can-do aliens? Might their success be a sign of nature&#x2019;s resilience in the face of the considerable damage humans have done to the planet?</p><p>I am an environmental journalist. Even to ask such questions gets me treated in some circles as a conservation heretic. I have met incredulity and hostility in equal measure. To be clear, I am not accusing environmentalists of being closet xenophobes or misanthropes, still less racists. But I have also found that I am far from alone in my concern that we have bought into some dangerous mythology about how nature works.</p><p>I am not questioning the motives&#x2014;to strengthen nature&#x2014;but the means. Many ecologists who actually study nature have told me that they feel conservationists are, with the best of intentions, getting the aliens wrong. And worse, that their efforts to keep out all foreign invaders of ecosystems might often be counterproductive, weakening nature rather than strengthening it. I have discovered that there is a scientific backlash against the simple formula that natives are good and aliens bad. The purpose of this book is to explore that new thinking and to ask what it should mean for conservation.</p><p>My conclusion is that mainstream conservationists are right that we need a rewilding of the Earth, but they are wrong if they imagine that we can achieve that by going backward. We need a new wild&#x2014;hence the title of this book. But the new wild will be very different from the old wild. We have changed our planet too much, and nature never goes backward. Nature&#x2019;s resilience is increasingly expressed in the strength and colonizing abilities of alien species. They are often the new natives. And in the new wild, we need to stand back and applaud.</p><p>There are horror stories about alien takeovers, of course. Most of those stories are set on small remote islands with only a few native species, where carnivorous rats, cats, and others hop off ships and cause mayhem. But elsewhere, most of the time, the tens of thousands of introduced species usually either swiftly die out or settle down and become model eco-citizens, pollinating crops, spreading seeds, controlling predators, and providing food and habitat for native species. They rarely eliminate natives. Rather than reducing biodiversity, the novel new worlds that result are usually richer in species than what went before. Even the &#x201c;terrorists&#x201d; of the conservation world, such as zebra mussels and tamarisk, Japanese knotweed and water hyacinth, often have a good side we rarely hear about.</p><p>After going on the trail of alien species across six continents, my conclusion is that their demonization says more about us and our fears of change than about them and their behavior. Some ardent wildlife lovers show a dark side when it comes to aliens. I sometimes think the more ardent they are, the more likely they are to be rabid about alien species. Understandable love of the local, the native, and the familiar&#x2014;of an imagined pristine environment before humans showed up&#x2014;too often becomes fear and hatred of the foreign and the unfamiliar.</p><p>This hostility is generally justified by outdated and ill-founded ideas about how nature works. We often think of life on Earth as made up of complex and tightly knit ecosystems like rainforests, wetlands, and coral reefs that are perfected and stable, with every species evolved to have a unique role. With that vision of nature, alien species are at best disruptive and at worst plain bad. But where did this idea come from? Darwin certainly never expressed it. He wrote that natural selection allowed species to adapt and survive, but he said nothing about ecosystems evolving to some sort of perfect state. They were just a jumble of species making their way in the world.</p><p>Today, fewer and fewer ecologists believe nature is either stable or perfectible. Real nature, they say, is often random, temporary, and constantly being remade by fire, flood, and disease&#x2014;with species coming and going, fitting in, adapting, or losing out. Change is the norm, they say. In this vision of nature, alien species are just like any others. Whether brought by humans or in more traditional ways, they are not an intrinsic threat to ecosystems. They are part of nature doing its thing, constantly reordering itself, constantly submitting to random events. Aliens may or may not cause change, but if change is the norm, then there is no harm in that. In any case, when invaded by foreign species, ecosystems don&#x2019;t collapse. Often they prosper better than before. The success of aliens becomes a sign of nature&#x2019;s dynamism, not its enfeeblement.</p><p>This new ecological thinking is critical for how we understand the meaning of conservation and for what actions we take in the name of protecting nature. If nature is perfected and vulnerable to outsiders, then conservationists have to line the barricades to keep out the interlopers and restore the balance of nature. That&#x2019;s what most conservationists think, and for a long time I shared that view. But if it is wrong, then keeping out aliens serves no obvious purpose. More than that, it may be counterproductive. Nature&#x2019;s desperados are proven colonists and exploiters of the ecological mess that humans leave behind them. So surely that makes them nature&#x2019;s best chance of healing the damage done by chain saws and plows, by pollution and climate change. Far from being nature&#x2019;s destroyers, aliens may be its reinvigorators, its salvation. They may be a sign that nature is not done. That it can bounce back. If that thinking is right, then simple conservation is shortsighted, and true environmentalists should be applauding the invaders.</p><p>I do not want to suggest that we should always welcome every alien species. We humans may sometimes want to protect the species we know and love&#x2014;in the habitats that we are familiar with. There is nothing wrong with that. And where alien species cause us inconvenience&#x2014;whether zebra mussels in American waterways, rats on oceanic islands, or rabbits in Australia&#x2014; we may want to try to halt their spread. Again, that is fair enough. We have a legitimate need to curb some of those excesses and a legitimate desire to protect what we like best. But we should be clear that when we do this, it is for ourselves and not for nature, whose needs are usually rather different.</p><p>While we seek to protect what we like in nature, we should remember something else. There is very little that is truly natural in nature anymore. There are very few, if any, pristine ecosystems to be preserved. Thanks to the activities of humans over thousands of years, no forests are virgin. They are all regenerating from past human invasions. We live in a new geological era, the Anthropocene, in which nothing is undisturbed and most ecosystems are a hodgepodge of native and alien species, often getting on in unexpected and productive ways.</p><p>Over my years as a journalist, I have written plenty of articles about how much harm alien species appear to do&#x2014;about killer algae, marauding water hyacinth, and many more. There was truth in them all, but they missed the bigger picture. This book is my journey to discover what conservation should really be about in the twenty-first century. It should not be about trying to preserve nature in aspic, still less about trying to recreate the past. That is both impossible and an affront to nature, like trying to turn the world into a giant zoo. In the twenty-first century, rather than fighting a losing battle to protect what we imagine to be pristine nature, we should be encouraging nature&#x2019;s rebirth, often through the dynamism and invasive instincts of its alien species.</p><p>Nature does not exist to do our bidding. While alien species may sometimes be a pain in the neck for human society, they are often exactly the shot in the arm that real nature needs. Conservationists who want to cosset nature like a delicate flower, to protect it from the threat of alien species, are the ethnic cleansers of nature, neutralizing the forces that they should be promoting. It is foolish to fear nature at its most dynamic&#x2014;red in tooth and claw, rhizome and spore, root and branch. As true environmentalists, we should rejoice when species burst through the paving stones of our cities or wash up on foreign shores. We should celebrate nature&#x2019;s powers of recovery. We should let it run wild. How else are species to thrive and respond to the disruption of our activities, including climate change, if not by invading new territories, by becoming aliens? True nature lovers should see that.</p><p>Harvard biologist Edward O. Wilson, the guru of biodiversity and rainforests, said that the twenty-first century will be &#x201c;the era of restoration in ecology.&#x201d; I hope so. But we will not be going back to a supposedly pristine world. We cannot. We should be restoring nature&#x2019;s wildness, not trying to turn one moment in its past into an ossified museum relic. The new wild will be different but no less dramatic and wonderful than the old wild. Alien species, and the novel ecosystems they inhabit, will be at the heart of it. We should bring them on.</p></p><h2>Battletech 25: Wolves on the Border</h2><p>Minobu Tetsuhara, a warrior-servant of the devious Warlord Grieg Samsonov, is forced to betray his former colleague, Jaime Wolf, and Wolf&#39;s mercenary Dragoons, after the mercenaries refuse to renew their contract with Samsonov and the warlord orders their deaths.

Tanner was a twenty-one-year-old graduate student when he saw his first ivory-billed woodpecker, one of America&#x2019;s Istudent when he saw his first ivory-billed woodpecker, one of America&#x2019;s rarest birds, in a remote swamp in northern Louisiana. At the time, he rarest birds, in a remote swamp in northern Louisiana. At the time, he was part of an ambitious expedition traveling across the country to record and photograph as many avian species as possible, a trip organized by Dr. Arthur Allen, founder of the famed Cornell Lab of Ornithology. Two years later, Tanner hit the road again, this time by himself and in search of only one species&#x2014;that ever-elusive ivory-bill. Sponsored by Cornell and the Audubon Society, Jim Tanner&#x2019;s work would result in some of the most extensive field research ever conducted on the magnificent woodpecker.</p><p><br>Drawing on Tanner&#x2019;s personal journals and written with the cooperation of his widow, Nancy, Ghost Birds recounts, in fascinating detail, the scientist&#x2019;s<br>dogged quest for the ivory-bill as he chased down leads in eight southern states. With Stephen Lyn Bales as our guide, we experience the same awe and excitement that Tanner felt when he returned to the Louisiana wetland he had visited earlier and was able to observe and document several of the &#x201c;ghost birds&#x201d;&#x2014;including a nestling that he handled, banded, and photographed at close range. Investigating the ivory-bill was particularly urgent because it was a fast-vanishing species, the victim of indiscriminant specimen hunting and widespread logging that was destroying its habitat. As sightings became rarer and rarer in the decades following Tanner&#x2019;s remarkable research, the bird was feared to have become extinct. Since 2005, reports of sightings in Arkansas and Florida made headlines and have given new hope to ornithologists and bird lovers, although extensive subsequent investigations have yet to produce definitive confirmation.</p><p><br>Before he died in 1991, Jim Tanner himself had come to believe that the majestic woodpeckers were probably gone forever, but he remained hopeful<br>that someone would prove him wrong. This book fully captures Tanner&#x2019;s determined spirit as he tracked down what was then, as now, one of ornithology&#x2019;s true Holy Grails.</p><p><br>STEPHEN LYN BALES is a naturalist at the Ijams Nature Center in Knoxville,<br>Tennessee.

Graff is currently on the Advisory Board of the Institute of Noetic Sciences--an organization founded by former astronaut Edgar Mitchell. Founder and former director of STARGATE, Graff continues to lecture on the program and parapsychological phenomena. He is also the author of River Dreams, published by Element.Given his scientific and military background, Graff takes a surprisingly personal approach to the topic of psychic experiences. In 1975, Graff was assigned to work with scientists from the Stanford Research Institute on the possible applications of "remote viewing" (the accessing of information without using the physical senses) for the U.S. Air Force. For 20 years, he directed remote viewing experiments in everything from espionage to drug enforcement, under the once-classified project he named "Stargate." Skeptical at first, Graff witnessed firsthand and then personally experienced remote viewing with the help of SRI scientists, eventually expanding his research to include intuition, telepathy, "precognitive" dreams and synchronicity ("meaningful coincidences"). Incidents abound: in one chapter, a student in a "Psychic Realm" course Graff taught apparently makes eggs appear in Graff's dream; in another, Graff is seated on a flight next to someone he has been trying to get in touch with for weeks. He focuses throughout on the potential of psi to aid in search-and-rescue missions, police work and healing, and he concludes with clear, simple steps anyone can take allegedly to discover and develop his or her own psychic abilities. Graff is a compelling storyteller and a convincing proponent of the continued expansion of psychic research. <br>Copyright 1998 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Hitler&#39;s First Victims: The Quest for Justice</h2><p>The remarkable story of Josef Hartinger, the German prosecutor who risked everything to bring to justice the first killers of the Holocaust and whose efforts would play a key role in the Nuremberg tribunal.<br><br> Before Germany was engulfed by Nazi dictatorship, it was a constitutional republic. And just before Dachau Concentration Camp became a site of Nazi genocide, it was a state detention center for political prisoners, subject to police authority and due process. The camp began its irrevocable transformation from one to the other following the execution of four Jewish detainees in the spring of 1933. Timothy W. Ryback&#x2019;s gripping and poignant historical narrative focuses on those first victims of the Holocaust and the investigation that followed, as Hartinger sought to expose these earliest cases of state-condoned atrocity. <br><br> In documenting the circumstances surrounding these first murders and Hartinger&#x2019;s unrelenting pursuit of the SS perpetrators, Ryback indelibly evokes a society on the brink&#x2014;one in which civil liberties are sacrificed to national security, in which citizens increasingly turn a blind eye to injustice, in which the bedrock of judicial accountability chillingly dissolves into the martial caprice of the Third Reich.<br><br> We see Hartinger, holding on to his unassailable sense of justice, doggedly resisting the rising dominance of Nazism. His efforts were only a temporary roadblock to the Nazis, but Ryback makes clear that Hartinger struck a lasting blow for justice. The forensic evidence and testimony gathered by Hartinger provided crucial evidence in the postwar trials.<br> <i><br>Hitler&#x2019;s First Victims</i> exposes the chaos and fragility of the Nazis&#x2019; early grip on power and dramatically suggests how different history could have been had other Germans followed Hartinger&#x2019;s example of personal courage in that time of collective human failure.</p><p>Timothy W.

Mild temperatures were foreseen for Bavaria as they were throughout southern Germany, with a few rain showers predicted for Friday, but brilliant, sunny skies for the Easter weekend. Previous generations hailed such days as Kaiserwetter, weather fit for a kaiser, a playful gibe at the former monarch&#x2019;s father, who appeared en plein air only when sufficient sunlight permitted his presence to be recorded by photographers. In the spring of 1933, some now spoke in higher-spirited and more reverential tones of F�hrerwetter. It was Adolf Hitler&#x2019;s first spring as chancellor.<br> &nbsp;<br> Shortly after nine o&#x2019;clock that morning, Josef Hartinger was in his second-floor office at Prielmayrstrasse 5, just off Karlsplatz in central Munich, when he received a call informing him that four men had been shot in a failed escape attempt from a recently erected detention facility for political prisoners in the moorlands near the town of Dachau. As deputy prosecutor for one of Bavaria&#x2019;s largest jurisdictions&#x2014;Munich II&#x2014;Hartinger was responsible for investigating potential crimes in a sprawling sweep of countryside outside Munich&#x2019;s urban periphery. &#x201c;My responsibilities included, along with the district courts in Garmisch and Dachau, all juvenile and major financial criminal matters for the entire jurisdiction, as well as all the so-called political crimes. Thus, for the Dachau camp, I had dual responsibilities,&#x201d; he later wrote.<br> &nbsp;<br> Deputy Prosecutor Hartinger was a model Bavarian civil servant. He was conservative in his faith and politics, a devout Roman Catholic and a registered member of the Bavarian People&#x2019;s Party, the centrist &#x201c;people&#x2019;s party&#x201d; of the Free State of Bavaria, founded by Dr. Heinrich Held, a fellow jurist and a fierce advocate of Bavarian autonomy. In April 1933, Hartinger was thirty-nine years old and belonged to the first generation of state prosecutors trained in the processes and values of a democratic republic. He pursued communists and National Socialists with equal vigor, and since Hitler&#x2019;s appointment as chancellor had watched the ensuing chaos and abuses with the confidence that such a government could not long endure. The Reich president, Paul von Hindenburg, had dismissed four chancellors in the past ten months: Heinrich Br�ning in May, Franz von Papen in November, and Kurt von Schleicher just that past January. There was nothing preventing Hindenburg from doing the same with his latest chancellor Adolf Hitler.<br> &nbsp;<br> Until then, Hartinger&#x2019;s daily commerce in crime involved burned barns, a petty larceny, an occasional assault, and, based on the remnant entries in the departmental case register, all too frequent incidents of adult transgressions against minors. Forty-one- year-old Max Lackner, for example, was institutionalized for two years for &#x201c;sexual abuse of children under fourteen.&#x201d; Ilya Malic, a salesman from Yugoslavia, was arrested after he &#x201c;forced a fourteen- year-old to French-kiss.&#x201d; Hartinger spoke discreetly of &#x201c;juvenile matters.&#x201d; Homicides were rare. The only registered murder for those years was a crime of passion committed by forty-seven-year-old Alfons Graf, who put four bullets into the head of his companion, Frau Reitinger, when he discovered her in the back of his company car with another man.<br> &nbsp;<br> But that year, following Hitler&#x2019;s January appointment as chancellor and the dramatic arson attack a month later that saw the stately Berlin Reichstag consumed in a nightmare conflagration of crashing glass, twisted steel, and surging flames, the jurisdiction was swept by an unprecedented wave of arrests in the name of national security. In Untergr�nberg, the farmer Franz Sales Mendler was arrested for making disparaging remarks about the new government. Maria Strohle, the wife of a power plant owner in Hergensweiler, told a neighbor that she heard Hitler had paid 50,000 reichsmarks to stage the arson attack on the Reichstag; she was sentenced to three months in prison, as was Franz Schliersmaier in B�senreutin, who put the amount at 500,000. One Bavarian was indicted for comparing Hitler to Stalin, and another for calling him a homosexual, and still another for suggesting he did not &#x201c;look&#x201d; German. &#x201c;Hitler is a foreigner who smuggled himself into the country,&#x201d; Julie Kolmeder said at a Munich beer garden a few streets from Hartinger&#x2019;s office. &#x201c;Just look at his face.&#x201d; A Munich coachman crossed the law with the indelicate aside, &#x201c;Hitler kann mich im Arsch lecken.&#x201d; Euphemistically: Hitler can kiss my ass. More than one person was prosecuted for calling a Nazi a &#x201c;Bazi.&#x201d;1 Thousands of others were taken into Schutzhaft, or protective custody, for no apparent reason at all.<br> &nbsp;<br> The shooting of four men in a failed escape from the Dachau Concentration Camp must have struck Hartinger&#x2019;s Roman Catholic sensibilities as particularly unfortunate, coming as it did just two days before Good Friday and amid an appeal by the archbishop of Munich and Freising for an Easter amnesty. &#x201c;In the name of, and on behalf of, the Bavarian bishops, I have the honor, Your Excellency, to extend the following request,&#x201d; the stately and imperious Cardinal Faulhaber had written Bavaria&#x2019;s Reich governor on April 3, &#x201c;that the investigation procedure for those in protective custody be expedited as quickly as possible in order to relieve the detainees and their families from emotional torment.&#x201d; Faulhaber expressed the desire that the detainees could be home in time for the Easter weekend, reminding the governor that there was no occasion more sacred to Christians than the Eastertide. &#x201c;If because of time constraints the investigations cannot be completed by Good Fri� day,&#x201d; Faulhaber proposed, &#x201c;then perhaps out of pure Christian and humanitarian grounds, an Easter amnesty can be granted from Good Friday until the end of Easter.&#x201d; The cardinal reminded the governor that in December 1914 Pope Benedict XV had invoked a Christmas armistice that stilled weapons on both sides of the front. What worked in a time of war must certainly work in peacetime, was the suggestion. Indeed, the previous month Chancellor Hitler himself had stated that his &#x201c;greatest ambition&#x201d; was to &#x201c;bring back to the nation the millions who had been misled, rather than to destroy them.&#x201d; What better way to instill a sense of national loyalty than through a gesture of Christian clemency on the holiday celebrating the resurrection of Jesus Christ? In this deeply Catholic corner of the country, when the archbishop of Munich and Freising, the oldest and most powerful of the state&#x2019;s bishoprics, spoke, the vast majority of Bavaria&#x2019;s four million Catholics listened, and on this occasion so did its political leadership.<br> &nbsp;<br> A week later, the state interior minister, Gauleiter Adolf Wagner, responded on the Reich governor&#x2019;s behalf.2 &#x201c;Most Honorable Herr Cardinal, I have the honor of responding to your letter to the governor of April 3, 1933,&#x201d; he wrote, &#x201c;to inform Your Eminence that we are in the process of reviewing the cases of everyone currently in detention, and that by Easter more than a thousand individuals will be released from protective custody.&#x201d; Wagner conveyed additional good news. The state government would permit Easter Mass to be celebrated among those practicing Roman Catholics who remained in detention as long as it did not constitute &#x201c;a burden to the state budget.&#x201d; Wagner recommended that &#x201c;the responsible religious authorities should be directly in contact with the administration of the individual detention camps, whom I will provide corresponding instructions as to how to deal with this matter.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> But now, amid heartening news of the Easter amnesty, came news of the deaths at Dachau. The call to Hartinger that Thursday morning was conducted in conformity with Paragraph 159 of the Strafprozessordnung, or Criminal Procedure Code, which required police officers &#x201c;to report immediately to the prosecutor or local magistrate&#x201d; any case in which &#x201c;a person has died from causes other than natural ones.&#x201d; Paragraph 160, in turn, obligated Hartinger to take immediate action: &#x201c;As soon as the prosecutor is informed of a suspected criminal act, either through a report or by other means, he is to investigate the matter until he has determined whether an indictment is to be issued.&#x201d; In compliance with his Paragraph 160 responsibilities, Hartinger called Dr. Moritz Flamm, the Munich II medical examiner, who was responsible for conducting postmor� tem examinations and autopsies in criminal investigations.<br> &nbsp;<br> Hartinger liked Dr. Flamm. Both men had previously worked in Munich I, Hartinger as an assistant prosecutor and Flamm as a part�time assistant medical examiner. Like Hartinger, he was a man of keen intelligence who had earned perfect grades in school. And like Hartinger, Flamm was a man of sterling professionalism. Flamm autopsies were models of precision and efficiency&#x2014; not a moment wasted, not a detail overlooked. Often thirty pages in length, they could withstand the most rigorous scrutiny in a court of law. Flamm was particularly proficient in bullet wounds. He had completed his medical training at the Ludwig Maximilian University of Munich in July 1914, just in time to join the 2nd Bavarian Infantry Regiment. He was dispatched to the front in August 1916 with the 3rd Medical Company, where he served meritoriously, earning an Iron Cross, the Bavarian Military Order, and the Friedrich August Cross. &#x201c;Particularly noteworthy is his absolute reliability and his medical professionalism that make him, without question, suited for any type of service,&#x201d; the company surgeon had commented after the war. &#x201c;At the front [Flamm] became virtually indispensable as the situation with medical sup- plies deteriorated,&#x201d; he wrote, &#x201c;all the while demonstrating a seemingly inexhaustible dedication to his work.&#x201d; The surgeon observed that Flamm was notably &#x201c;modest&#x201d; and &#x201c;by nature rather sensitive,&#x201d; but possessed of intelligence, sound judgment, and humor even &#x201c;in the most desperate situations.&#x201d; The surgeon said he had come to know in Flamm a physician &#x201c;for whom one can only wish full and well-deserved recognition and in good conscience can provide unqualified praise.&#x201d; Flamm&#x2019;s handwriting, precise and refined, with playful, elegant flourishes, reflects his calm and easy competence.<br> &nbsp;<br> Flamm also demonstrated a fierce independence and willing- ness to act on his conscience when circumstances demanded. In the spring of 1919, amid a failed Bolshevik coup that saw thousands taken into protective custody&#x2014;with and without cause&#x2014;he exercised his authority as chief physician of a military hospital to order the release of two patients who were being detained on suspicion of collaborating with communists. Flamm was accused of Bolshevik sympathies, but was taken into &#x201c;personal protection&#x201d; by his superior, who vouched for him &#x201c;administratively, professionally, and politically&#x201d; and insisted that he was a man free of &#x201c;any personal, moral, or political blemish.&#x201d; After two years with Flamm in Munich II, Hartinger had come to share the same high regard. In addition, Flamm had a driver&#x2019;s license and his own motorcar.<br> &nbsp;<br> 1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The word Bazi can be translated as &#x201c;swindler&#x201d; or &#x201c;scoundrel,&#x201d; and derives from the Bavarian dialect, as does the word Nazi, a shortening of the word Nationalsozialist, but also an old nickname for Ignatius, a popular Bavarian name commonly associated with a country bumpkin, and applied disparagingly to Hitler followers. A Nazi never called another Nazi a &#x201c;Nazi.&#x201d; They referred to each other as National Socialists or &#x201c;party comrades.<br> 2. &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The Gauleiter, or district leader, was the Nazi Party official responsible for local affairs. These Nazi Party districts corresponded to the thirty�three voting districts for the Reichstag elections. In 1941, the number of Gauleiter and corresponding districts was increased to forty�three.</p></p><h2>My Little Pony Tails of Equestria Story Telling Game Core Rule Book: The Storytelling Game</h2><p>This book is a manual for a storytelling game that allows you and your friends to explore the amazing and magical world of Equestria.

Even his wife, long dead, didn't know the real man behind the calm, cultured mask he presents to the world. Only an old army buddy from Vietnam, Patrick Skelly, knows what Marder is capable of. Then a shattering piece of news awakens Marder's buried desire for vengeance, and with nothing left to lose, he sets off to punish the people whose actions, years earlier, changed his life.

He has a PhD in marine sciences and began freelance writing while working in Washington D.C., as a policy analyst and speech writer. Since 1990, he has been a full-time writer. He is married and lives in Seattle, Washington.<p>1</p> <p>Mexico.</p> <p>This was Marder&#x2019;s first thought when the doctor explained what the shadow on the screen meant, what the tests implied. Mexico meant unfinished business, put off for years, nearly forgotten, until this unexpected deadline: now or never. That was the decent part; the cowardly part was the terror of explanation, of seeing the faces of his friends and family wear that look, the one that said, You&#x2019;re dying and I&#x2019;m not and as much as I care for you I can&#x2019;t treat you like a real person anymore. He could see this very look in the doctor&#x2019;s face now, presaging all the others to come. Gergen was a good guy, a fine GP; Marder had been seeing him for years, the annual checkup. Something of a joke this, for Marder was hale as a bear, arteries like the bore of a Mossberg 12-gauge, all the numbers in the right zones, remarkable for a man in his fifties. They had a good relationship; if not quite pals, they&#x2019;d always joked through the exams, the same jokes. Marder always said, &#x201c;Tell me you love me first,&#x201d; as the doctor slipped the greased, rubbered finger up toward the perfectly normal prostate.</p> <p>And other humorous repartee before and during: current events, sports, but mainly books. Marder was a book editor of some reputation&#x2014;he&#x2019;d been editor in chief of a major house before turning freelance some years back. Gergen fancied himself a literary fellow, and Marder usually remembered to bring along the latest thing he&#x2019;d worked on, a history, a biography; today it had been one explaining the origins of the financial crisis. That was his editorial specialty, doorstops dense as nougat that explained our terrifying new world.</p> <p>Gergen was explaining Marder&#x2019;s own new world now. The thing was deep in the brain, immune from surgical intervention, immune even from the clever methods by which a tube could be passed up the arterial pathways to fix the deadly little bubble. When Gergen finished, Marder asked the usual question and got the usual answer: impossible to tell. It could stop growing, which occasionally happened, for reasons unknown; the most likely scenario was leakage, stroking out, the hideous decline, stretched out over months or years; or it could just pop, in which case, curtains, and the next world. Marder had believed in the next world all his life, more or less, and did not entirely dread the journey, but lingering&#x2014;in paralysis, helplessness, idiocy&#x2014;filled him with horror.</p> <p>They shook hands solemnly when Marder was dressed and ready to leave. Gergen said he was sorry, and Marder could tell he meant it but also that he was glad to see him go. Doctors are irritated by those beyond help; Marder knew the feeling&#x2014;he&#x2019;d worked with any number of authors who couldn&#x2019;t write and wouldn&#x2019;t learn. Irritating: death, like lack of talent, an embarrassment to be avoided.</p> <p>*&nbsp;&nbsp; *&nbsp;&nbsp; *</p> <p>Marder left the doctor&#x2019;s office and walked toward Union Square, through the thronged streets, weaving in the practiced New Yorker&#x2019;s way through all the people who were going to outlive him, who would be in their lives after he was not. He found that this knowledge did not depress him. His step was light; he cast his eye almost benevolently at the passing faces, so many of them bearing the grim mask of the New Yorker, guarded, intent on the next deal or destination. The world seemed sharper than it had when he entered the office just a few hours ago, as if someone had wiped clean his smudged glasses. He had almost reached the park when it struck him that the last time he had felt this preternatural clarity was years ago, when he was a soldier in Vietnam, in the night forests along the Laotian border. This, too, was strange: Marder almost never recollected that war.</p> <p>Ordinarily he would have taken the subway home, but now he walked. The day was fair, sunny, cool, a nice September afternoon in the city; nature did not mourn for him, no pathetic fallacy on offer for Marder. As he walked, his mind bubbled with plans; it was free with the liberty of the void. This is the first day of the rest of your life, as the happiness advice books always said, but since there was also a chance that it was the last day, the silly phrase took on a more interesting, more cosmic overtone, what the sages meant about living in the Now.</p> <p>Marder was a deliberate man, a careful thinker, a detail guy, but now his mind seemed to be running with unusual speed, concentrated with the prospect of dying, at some date to be determined. So bemused, he nearly stepped into the path of a cab at Houston Street. Yes, that would solve it: the black bubble of suicide floated across his mind, quickly punctured. Quite aside from the religious objections, Marder knew he couldn&#x2019;t do that to his children, not<i> two</i> parents checking out that way, but now came the thought that placing himself in a situation where he was likely to be killed was not at all the same thing, especially if by so doing he could accomplish his purpose down in Mexico. His mind steadied, plans started to jell. He didn&#x2019;t know if he could do it, but it seemed right to die trying.</p> <p>*&nbsp;&nbsp; *&nbsp;&nbsp; *</p> <p>At Prince Street he passed a group of street musicians, South American Indians by the look of them, in woven ponchos and felt hats&#x2014;a pair of flutes, a drummer, a woman with a rattling gourd who sang in a high and nasal voice. Marder spoke fluent, almost accentless Mexican Spanish, but her lyric was difficult to follow, something about a dove, something about the ruin of love. When the song ended, he dropped a twenty in her hat among the singles and coins, was rewarded by a brilliant flash of white teeth, in the shining obsidian eyes a look of amazed gratitude. She blessed him in the name of God, in Spanish; he returned the blessing in the same language and walked on.</p> <p>Marder&#x2019;s generosity here was not connected to his recent news; he often gave ridiculous sums away, although always privately. Proust, he&#x2019;d heard once, habitually tipped 100 percent, and Marder occasionally did the same. Although born into modest circumstances, Marder was rich, secretly rich, through a stroke of luck so absurd that Marder had never accepted it as his due, making him different from nearly every other rich person of his acquaintance: wealth without feelings of entitlement was something of a rarity, in his experience. That he still worked at all, and in a profession not noted for excess remuneration, was a bit of uncharacteristic deviousness, a cover story. Only his lawyer and his accountant knew how much he was worth. His children and a number of other beneficiaries would be <i>extremely</i> surprised at probate.</p> <p>Continuing south on Broadway, he passed a massive industrial building with an ornate cast-iron front. The ground floor of this structure boasted a strip of elegant eateries and boutiques; the rest of it contained luxury condos. During his boyhood, however, it had been a printing plant, where his father had worked for thirty years as a Linotype operator. It always gave Marder a tiny pang when he happened to pass by. Maybe it was mere nostalgia, but he thought there was something wrong about a city that had become largely a dwelling of the very rich and the people who serviced their needs. He missed the city of his boyhood, then the greatest port, the largest manufacturing entrep�t on earth. He recalled it as exciting and comprehensible in a way that the current city was not&#x2014;a place that now shipped only digits, that made nothing but money. He thought he wouldn&#x2019;t miss this aspect of the city in the time he had left.</p> <p>The Tribeca loft he lived in was currently worth a bit over a million, but this was easily explained: he&#x2019;d bought it back in the early eighties with an insurance payoff from his father&#x2019;s death. &#x201c;Lucky stiff!&#x201d; was the usual comment. Real estate bonanzas were hardly unusual in the city, and no one thought it remarkable. It was even true, but not nearly as remarkable as the larger story.</p> <p>Having reached this loft, Marder went to the area he used as his office, sat at his desk, and began to disassemble his life. He had a book in process, and this he passed off on a subcontract basis to another freelancer he knew, who had a pregnant wife and a pair of school-aged kids. Marder stifled the man&#x2019;s effusions of gratitude; that was the easy part. Then he called the author and broke his heart, pleading unspecified health issues as an excuse, assuring him that the work would be competently done and that, to make up for dropping the project, he would reduce the contracted completion payment. He would have to make up this fee to the substitute editor (a wonderful man, several books on the List, you&#x2019;ll<i> love</i> him, and so forth), but that would not be a problem.</p> <p>Third call: Bernie Nathan, the accountant, who asked, when he heard what Marder wanted, whether he was in some kind of trouble. No, he was not, and could Bernie have the cash on hand this afternoon? Fourth call: Hal Danielson, the lawyer. A few little changes to the will. A similar question, similarly answered: no, not in trouble at all.</p> <p>Fifth call: H. G. Ornstein answered on the first ring. Ornstein&#x2019;s business, which was running a tiny left-wing journal, was clearly not pressing. After the pleasantries and the usual damning of the condition into which our once-great nation had fallen, Marder asked, &#x201c;So, Ornstein, you still living with your mother?&#x201d;</p> <p>Yes, and it was driving him crazy; wonderful woman, but not so wonderful living in the same house. Ornstein&#x2019;s wife had, after many years of noble poverty, despaired of the inevitable victory of the people and filed for divorce. Ornstein, a decent man, had done the decent thing and moved out. Marder did not believe in the ultimate victory of the people either, but he admired grit and selflessness. He&#x2019;d known the man since college, when Ornstein had also tried his hand at stand-up comedy in the angry lefty mode of Mort Sahl or George Carlin. The man was a dead-on mimic but lacked edge, and had failed at that too.</p> <p>When Marder told him he needed a friend to look after his loft for an indefinite period, the phone line hissed silence for nearly thirty seconds, then another undesired gush, to which Marder replied, &#x201c;No, don&#x2019;t thank me, you&#x2019;ll be doing <i>me</i> a favor. I&#x2019;ll drop the keys and paperwork in the mail today. Can you move in Friday? Great.&#x201d;</p> <p>*&nbsp;&nbsp; *&nbsp;&nbsp; *</p> <p>Now Marder&#x2019;s finger brought up the contact list on his cell phone but hesitated above the next necessary number. Time for some procrastination. He went to the closet in the loft&#x2019;s bedroom and pulled out a battered leather gladstone bag of Mexican manufacture. He had not used it in some time, for now he traveled with a black nylon roll-aboard like the rest of humanity, but he thought that this one was the right container for his truncated new life. Into it went lightweight shirts and trousers, the usual underwear and toilet articles, a linen jacket and a leather one, leather sandals, several softly worn bandannas, a real Panama straw hat, the kind you could roll up. He hung his best suit in a garment bag, providing for any formal event or to be buried in. He placed the packed bag at the foot of his bed and then opened a tall, narrow steel safe.</p> <p>Marder was not exactly a gun nut. He disliked the policies of the National Rifle Association and thought the general availability of powerful semiautomatic weapons in his nation was insane, but, despite that, he liked guns. He admired their malign beauty as he admired tigers and cobras, and he was a wonderfully proficient shot. From his gun safe he brought out a rifle and two pistols, together with all the boxes of ammunition he had on hand. It was irrational, he knew, but he did not want his survivors to have to dispose of them. Besides, it was always convenient to be armed on road voyages through the regions of Mexico where he intended to travel. He asked himself why he cared, since the thing in his head was more or less in charge of his life. Mr. Thing, as he now decided to call it, had its own agenda. Mr. Thing could discharge him from his life without notice, but in the meantime he would remain Marder, although a Marder who would not be an occasion of pain to the people he cared about.</p> <p>In furtherance of this goal, he now placed himself at his computer and shopped for a truck, for he did not want to fly commercial, which could be traced. It took him only half an hour to arrange for the purchase of a Ford F-250 fitted with a seven-foot hardwall Northstar camper, model name &#x201c;Freedom,&#x201d; which Marder thought pretty amusing under the circumstances. The seller was in Long Island City, and Marder made an appointment to pick it up late that day. Another call to Bernie: courier a check over to the dealership. This time Bernie did not ask questions.</p> <p>*&nbsp;&nbsp; *&nbsp;&nbsp; *</p> <p>Marder spun on his chair and looked around the office, reflecting that he&#x2019;d spent an extraordinary amount of time within these walls. Two of them, the ones in view of his desk, were painted eggshell. Set into one of these was the big industrial-scale window looking out on Worth Street. Behind him, the rear wall of the room and the remaining sidewall were painted bloodred. That had been Chole&#x2019;s section of the home office. He had his elegant steel-and-rosewood desk, his back-saving leather chair, infinitely adjustable with little wheels and levers. Her desk was the antique rolltop with pigeonholes he&#x2019;d bought her for their fifth (or wooden) anniversary. She had used a wooden office chair she&#x2019;d brought in from the sidewalk in the days of their poverty, its cushion upholstered in bright serape cloth. Above her desk, a broad section of the wall was covered in thick cork panels, on which she&#x2019;d stuck family photos, posters, found objects, cartoons, newspaper and magazine clippings from the Mexican press.

It had been torn roughly out of the pages of <i>Panorama del Puerto</i>, the newspaper in L�zaro C�rdenas; on it his wife had written lines from a poem by Octavio Paz on the occasion of the famous massacre of students in 1968.

No one had been punished for the murders, just another pair out of the forty thousand or so that the<i> narcoviolencia</i> had claimed. Everyone knew who had done it, and by all reports he was still enjoying his life, buoyed by an ocean of dollars and his apparent impunity.

From Isabella of Castile, and her granddaughter Mary Tudor, to Catherine de Medici, Anne Boleyn, and Elizabeth Tudor, these women wielded enormous power over their territories, shaping the course of European history for over a century. Across boundaries and generations, these royal women were mothers and daughters, mentors and prot�g�es, allies and enemies. For the first time, Europe saw a sisterhood of queens who would not be equaled until modern times. A fascinating group biography and a thrilling political epic, <i>Game of Queens</i> explores the lives of some of the most beloved (and reviled) queens in history.<b><br></b></p><p><strong>An Amazon Best Book of December 2016:</strong> When chess was first played, all the human figures were male. Only around the eight century did the Queen appear and not until the sixteenth century did the Queen become the most powerful piece in chess. Credit for this development is given to Isabella of Spain, the &#x201c;warrior queen,&#x201d; herself a skillful and enthusiastic chess player. Coincidentally, from Isabella&#x2019;s accession to the throne in 1474 through the next hundred years, an Age of Queens flourished to a degree not seen before or since, with women on the thrones of many European countries. Both the influence of chess and Isabella of Spain feature heavily in Game of Queens. Though few of the female regents met one another, the passage of power and influence (including strategic chess plays) flowed from mothers to daughters and from mentors to protegees, across borders and across generations. The stories of some of the greatest (and hated) queens are told here (in an amusing author&#x2019;s note, Gristwood points out that in a story with sixteen protagonists, eight of them are named either Mary or Margaret and she absolves herself of responsibility for any confusion that may result). Against a backdrop of religious reformations and the innovations of the new age, Gristwood deftly shows how the explosion of female rule came about, the machinations and power plays behind the thrones, and how the Age of Queens ultimately played out; unsurprisingly, fidelity and fertility were used to create scandals that threatened to topple each Queen. From Isabella of Castile and her granddaughter Mary Tudor, to Catherine de Medici, Anne Boleyn, and Elizabeth Tudor, what could be a dry examination of policy and power becomes, in Gristwood&#x2019;s hands, a lively, accessible, occasionally hilarious, absorbing account of an astonishing era. <em>--Vannessa Cronin, The Amazon Book Review</em><b>Sarah Gristwood</b> is a regular contributor to many London publications as well as a commentator on royal and historical affairs.

Officer Hanson, a Vietnam veteran, has abandoned academia for the life-and-death clarity of police work, a way to live with the demons that followed him home from the war. <br> But Hanson knows that justice requires more than simply enforcing the penal code. He believes in becoming a part of the community he serves--which is why, unlike most officers, he chooses to live in the same town where he works. This strategy serves him well...to a point. He forges a precarious friendship with Felix Maxwell, the drug king of East Oakland, based on their shared sense of fairness and honor. He falls in love with Libya the moment he sees her, a confident and outspoken black woman. He is befriended by Weegee, a streetwise eleven-year-old who is primed to become a dope dealer. <br> Every day, every shift, tests a cop's boundaries between the man he wants to be and the officer of the law he's required to be.

He is a multiple Nebula Award finalist who lives in Georgia with his wife Maureen.Set in the 23rd century, this straightforward adventure from Nebula-finalist McDevitt (Omega) explores the immorality of big business and the short-sightedness of the American government in minimizing support for space travel. These destructive forces are held off by the insight and brilliance of individuals such as the influential Gregory MacAllister, editor of a non-partisan journal, The Nation, and Priscilla "Hutch" Hutchins, manager of a government-sponsored space-research agency, the Academy. While often on opposite sides of support for the Academy's research budget, MacAllister and Hutch together uncover and react to evidence that Orion Tours' CEO, Charles Dryden, is engaged in a massive conspiracy to jump-start his intergalactic tour business. MacAllister unmasks the others supporting Dryden's faked alien attacks, targeting a physicist who colluded in the hoax. His skepticism about space travel, however, prevents him from seeing the existence of real aliens, something Hutch must pursue at risk to her career. Subtract the "inspirational quotations" and the newspaper headlines appended to some chapters, and what's left is enough space travel, heroics and speculation about the history of the universe to satisfy most hard SF enthusiasts.<br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

They represent for us a path leading away from the one-sided utilitarian technology of contemporary civilization, a valid and practical teaching utilizing all the sources of energy, harmony and knowledge everywhere surrounding us. 3.) They give us permanent standards in an age where truth seems to dissolve in a continual shifting of concepts. 4.) This resulting neurosis and insecurity is given a complete balance and harmony through the Essene teachings.</p><p></p><h2>Writing &amp; illuminating, &amp; lettering</h2><p>Classic study of penmanship, lettering and illumination covers fundamentals of acquiring a formal hand, creating manuscript books, techniques of illumination, lettering and methods of constructing and arranging letters, the Roman alphabet and its derivatives, lettering on metal, wood and stone, other topics.

Haddam ( Precious Blood ) isolates a group of manipulative, influential characters--at least one of whom is a murderer--at a Long Island Sound estate for a seminar about a much-publicized p. 143 proposed bill to benefit children with Down's syndrome. Among the power-mongers in attendance are doltish presidential candidate Stephen Whistler Fox, who has been having strange blackouts at fundraisers; his meek wife, Janet, grieving for a deceased child with Down's; his possessive, witchy mistress, Patchen Rawls; his shifty right-hand man, Dan Chester; and a specialist in the treatment of retarded children, Dr. Kevin Debrett. Debrett is found dead in his guest room with nary a wound nor a sign of struggle, and a second victim is soon to follow. Alert ex-FBI man Gregor Demarkian examines both crimes and drops hints about the murderer(s) in their midst. Juicy gossip abounds, tension builds and all present are suitably suspect as Demarkian expertly wraps up loose ends in this entertaining, satisfying mystery. <br>Copyright 1991 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Deity (The Third Covenant Novel)</h2><p>Escape with the remarkable third novel of the acclaimed Covenant series from #1 New York Times bestselling Jennifer L.

Back on Farholme, Commander Merral D&#x2019;Avanos recovers from his wounds after the battle at Fallambet where the intruders were destroyed. Yet even as Merral dreams of a return to peace, he receives a warning of imminent war on a massive scale he cannot ignore. Amid the urgent preparations for battle, Merral and his friends realize the inadequacy of their defenses. Then, with weeks to spare before the predicted eve of ware, Merral receives an offer of assistance from the strangest of sources. But can it be trusted? As the wave of war finally crashes over Farholme, Merral must find the answer to other questions in the heat of battle: Can Farholme survive the growing internal strains? Who will pay the price for victory? Will his own weaknesses undo both him and his world?</p><p>Born in Wales, <b>Chris Walley</b> grew up in northern England. He studied earth sciences at university and has a doctorate in geology. He taught at the American University of Beirut in Lebanon from 1980 to 1984 and then returned to Wales and spent ten years as a consultant with the oil industry. He began writing in the late eighties and had two novels, Heart of Stone and Rock of Refuge, published under the pseudonym of John Haworth. In 1994, along with his family, Chris returned to Lebanon to teach again at AUB. In 1998, he came back to Wales and began writing again. He is currently fitting his writing in between teaching geology, environmental science, and geography at a local college. Chris and his wife live in an old cottage on the edge of Swansea.With <i>The Shadow and Night</i>, we barely saw the beginnings of Chris Walley's epic Lamb Among the Stars series. Evil returned to the Assembly Worlds after thousands of years of peace and contentment. Then-Forester Merral D'Avanos discovered the intrusion on the distant planet of Farholme, but before he and his friends could warn the rest of the Assembly, their space Gate was destroyed, cutting off communication and swift travel between their planets. <br><br><i>The Dark Foundations</i> wastes no time in expanding the story immensely by revealing the two opposing forces in this interstellar struggle&#x2014;both the Assembly and the Dominion of Lord-Emperor Nezhuala. While Farholme is the central battle in this struggle, the forces in play stretch across the galaxy with consequences for trillions of people. <br><br>Nezhuala seeks nothing less than total conquest of the Assembly, and Farholme is but his first beachhead. A group of diplomats arrive first, attempting to convince Farholme to join the Dominion peaceably. Merral, now Commander of Farholme's fledgling defense force, and his friends are faced with evil and deception unlike anything they've faced in their lives... even as the corruption of sin spreads throughout their own society. <br><br>While Walley broadens the scope and scale of this sci-fi epic, he manages to return the focus to his core characters (and a few new ones) for the majority of the volume. Merral, Vero, et al, who became real to readers in the first part of this series, continue their development, in many ways. Merral himself faces struggles both personal and spiritual, leading to a beautiful climax between good and evil. <br><br>At the same time, Walley develops some of the unique sci-fi/spiritual concepts he introduced earlier, such as Below-Space and the Dominion's demonic connections, as well as introducing new and even more fascinating concepts (such as a sci-fi equivalent to the Tower of Babel). <br><br>Despite its length, this entire series doesn't feel too long&#x2014;in fact, it feels too short so far. There's so much more that <i>can</i> happen, and I'm very anxious to see the next volume. Highly Recommended</p><h2>The Family Read Aloud Christmas Treasury</h2><p>Fifty-four works of well-loved poets and authors compose this holiday collection.</p><p>Marc Brown, who was born in Erie, Pennsylvania in 1946, received great encouragement and support from his grandmother and uncle. Inspired by the books of Maurice Sendak, Brown decided to pursue his ambition of becoming an illustrator. After receiving a B.F.A. in painting from the Cleveland Institute of Art, he worked as a TV art director, a professor of mechanical drawing, and a freelance illustrator, before becoming a writer. In his books, he addresses the fears and problems which children face and events like friendship, family, school and pets. For his illustrations, Brown uses pencil with watercolor on a variety of papers to achieve different visual effects. The &#34;Arthur&#34; series, about the everyday adventures of a lovable aardvark, began in 1976 and continues to this day with 25 titles published. Brown has also created other series such as the &#34;Rhymes&#34; series, and the nonfiction &#34;Dinosaur&#34; series, which conveys messages of do&#39;s and don&#39;ts. These series, like the stories of Arthur, hold the attention of young children while transporting their imaginations on magical journeys.</p><h2>Chicken Soup for the Christian Soul (Chicken Soup for the Soul)</h2><p><p>These stories will deepen your Christian faith by helping you practice Christian values in your daily life: at home, at work and in the community.

In the Sierra Nevadas to the east, the snow was piling up and would offer great skiing once the storm had passed.<br><br> In the foothills of the Sierras in the town of Grass Valley, California, the streets were flooded, and in some parts of town, the power was off where trees had blown down. At the small church, the heavy rain and high winds beat against the windows with a violence that Father O�Malley had never before heard. In his tiny bedroom, O�Malley was laboriously writing Sunday�s sermon by candlelight. Out of the darkness, the phone in his office rang, shattering his concentration. He picked up the candle, and with his hand cupped in front of it, ambled down the hall in a sphere of dim flickering light.<br><br> As he picked up the phone, a voice quickly asked, �Is this Father O�Malley?�<br> �Yes.�<br> �I�m calling from the hospital in Auburn,� said a concerned female voice. �We have a terminally ill patient who is asking us to get someone to give him his last rites. Can you come quickly?�<br> �I�ll try my best to make it,� O�Malley answered. �But the river is over its banks, and trees are blown down all over town. It�s the worst storm I�ve seen in all the years I�ve been here. Look for me within two hours.�<br><br> The trip was only 30 miles, but it would be hard going. The headlights on Father O�Malley�s 20-year-old car barely penetrated the slashing rain, and where the winding road crossed and recrossed the river in a series of small bridges, trees had blown down across the river�s banks. But for some reason, there was always just enough room for Father O�Malley to make his way around them. His progress was slow and cautious, but he continued on toward the hospital.<br><br> Not a single vehicle passed him during his long, tense journey. It was way past midnight, and anyone else out on a night like this would also have to be on an emergency mission.<br><br> Finally, in the near distance, the lights of the small hospital served as a beacon to guide O�Malley for the last 500 yards, and he hoped he had arrived in time. He parked behind the three other cars in the parking lot to avoid as much wind as possible, slipped into the right-hand seat and awkwardly wrestled his way into his raincoat before stepping out into the wind-whipped deluge.<br><br> With his tattered Bible tucked deep inside his overcoat pocket, O�Malley forced the car door open, stepped out and then leaned into the wind. Its power almost bowled him over, and he was nearly blown away from the hospital entrance. Once inside, the wind slammed the hospital door shut behind him, and as he was shaking the water from his coat, he heard footsteps headed his way. It was the night nurse.<br><br> �I�m so glad you could get here,� she said. �The man I called you about is slipping fast, but he is still coherent. He�s been an alcoholic for years, and his liver has finally given out. He�s been here for a couple of weeks this time and hasn�t had one single visitor. He lives up in the woods, and no one around here knows much about him. He always pays his bill with cash and doesn�t seem to want to talk much. We�ve been treating him off and on for the last couple of years, but this time it�s as though he�s reached some personal decision and has given up the fight.�<br><br> �What�s your patient�s name?� O�Malley asked.<br> �The hospital staff has just been calling him Tom,� she replied.<br> In the soft night-light of the room, Tom�s thin sallow countenance looked ghostlike behind a scraggly beard. It was as though he had stepped over the threshold and his life was already gone.<br><br> �Hello, Tom. I�m Father O�Malley. I was passing by and thought we could talk a bit before you go to sleep for the night.�<br> �Don�t give me any of that garbage,� Tom replied. �You didn�t just stop by at 3:30 in the morning. I asked that dumb night nurse to call someone to give me my last rites because I know my deal is done and it�s my turn to go. Now get on with it.�<br> �Patience,� said Father O�Malley, and he began to say the prayers of the last rites.<br><br> After the �Amen,� Tom perked up a bit, and he seemed to want to talk.<br> �Would you like to make your confession?� O�Malley asked him.<br> �Absolutely not,� Tom answered. �But I would like to just talk with you a bit, before I go.�<br> And so Tom and Father O�Malley talked about the Korean War, and the ferocity of the winter storm, and the knee-high grass and summer blossoms that would soon follow.<br><br> Occasionally, during the hour or so before daylight, Father O�Malley would ask Tom again, �Are you sure you don�t want to confess anything?�<br> After a couple of hours, and after about the fourth or fifth time that Father O�Malley asked the same question, Tom replied, �Father, when I was young, I did something that was so bad that I�ve never told anyone about it. It was so bad that I haven�t spent a single day since without thinking about it and reliving the horror.�<br> �Don�t you think it would be good for you to tell me about it?� O�Malley asked.<br> �Even now, I still can�t talk about what I did,� Tom said. �Even to you.�<br> But as the first gray light of dawn crept into the room and began to form shadows, Tom sadly said, �Okay. It�s too late for anyone to do anything to me now, so I guess I might as well tell you.�<br><br> �I worked as a switchman on the railroad all my life, until I retired a few years ago and moved up here to the woods. Thirty-two years, two months and 11 days ago, I was working in Bakersfield on a night kind of like tonight.� Tom�s face became intense as the words began to tumble out. �It happened during a bad winter storm with a lot of rain, 50-mile-an-hour winds and almost no visibility. It was two nights before Christmas and to push away the gloom, the whole yard crew drank all through the swing shift. I was drunker than the rest of them, so I volunteered to go out in the rain and wind and push the switch for the northbound 8:30 freight.�<br><br> Tom�s voice dropped almost to a whisper as he went on. �I guess I was more drunk than I thought I was because I pushed that switch in the wrong direction. At 45 miles an hour that freight train slammed into a passenger car at the next crossing and killed a young man, his wife and their two daughters.<br> �I have had to live with my being the cause of their deaths every day since then.�<br> There was a long moment of silence as Tom�s confession of this tragedy hung in the air. After what seemed like an eternity, Father O�Malley gently put his hand on Tom�s shoulder and said very quietly, �If I can forgive you, God can forgive you, because in that car were my mother, my father and my two older sisters.�<br><br> <i>Warren Miller</i><br><br><br> <p>�1996 Warren Miller.

Some of the pieces in Open Letters, such as "Dear Dr. Husak" and the essay "The Power of the Powerless," are by now almost legendary for their influence on a generation of Eastern European dissidents; others, such as some of Havel's prison correspondence and his private letter to Alexander Dubcek, appear in English for the first time. All of them bear the unmistakable imprint of Havel's intellectual rigor, moral conviction, and unassuming eloquence, while standing as important additions to the world's literature of conscience.<br><i>From the Trade Paperback edition.</i></p><p>"Brilliant and perceptive analyses...of the abuse of power by bureaucracies driven by cynical self-interest." -- Boston Globe<p>"An inspiring collection...a fitting tribute to a cultural and political hero, and a valuable resource for anyone seeking reassurance that the principles of democracy are still cherished in our time." -- Kirkus Reviews</p><p>"Havel's essays...show a complex political and moral sensibility.

Campodimele, Italy, has for some time attracted the interest of the medical community: the people here lead extraordinarily long lives, enjoy low blood pressure and low cholesterol, and stay active and healthy to their last years.<br>What is it about this place that makes it so easy to live well and long? In <i>A Year in the Village of Eternity</i>, Tracey Lawson goes beyond the medical figures, immersing herself in the lifestyle and timeless eating habits of this vibrant place. Daybreak in Campodimele finds villagers in their seventies and eighties rising to tend their olive trees, chasing their chickens uphill, or weaving through mountain roads on a Vespa. <br>In Campodimele, the seasons and the bounty of the land dictate the food on the table, and each month brings its own traditions of harvesting and foraging, cooking and preserving.

Encouraging freedom from strict recipes and set lists of ingredients, <em>The Improvisational Cook</em> is the ideal cookbook for anyone who has ever considered pairing prosciutto with roasted peaches or putting parmesan on french fries.</p></p><p><p>In <em>The Improvisational Cook</em>, Sally Schneider helps home cooks declare their independence from recipes and set lists of ingredients and offers an invitation to a fun, more spontaneous way to cook with whatever is on hand. But how do you become an improvisational cook?</p><p>Once you understand how a basic technique or a recipe works, you can then begin to improvise. Start with one of <em>The Improvisational Cook</em>'s essential recipes, such as Caramelized Onions. A special "Understanding" section follows, explaining the internal "logic" of the recipe and its creative possibilities. With that in mind, a savory onion jam; a real onion dip; a quick bruschetta topped with the onions, anchovies, and olives; or a rustic onion soup with dried porcini mushrooms is just a step or two beyond. Sally's notated improvisations illustrate simple, clever approaches and can be followed as is or used as a jumping-off point.</p><p>The possibilities are endless. Slow-roast fish at 300 degrees, along with some cherry tomatoes and olives for a sauce. Prepare a savory lemon jam to go with lamb or veal chops, or turn it into a cake filling. Roast a whole lobster instead of a fish in a salt crust. Add minced rosemary or Earl Grey tea to butter cookie dough. Turn a brownie batter into an elegant pepper-scented chocolate cake.</p><p>Sally gives you the know-how to embellish, adapt, change, alter, modify, and experiment in your cooking with plenty of encouragement and helpful information -- the tools and insights you need to find your own voice and cook improvi-sationally.

Batman begins the decade fighting paranormal villains, switches to a tongue-in-cheek style reflective of the popular TV show, and ends the '60s alone as the "Dark Knight" avenging the wrongs done by petty criminals and crime lords after Robin leaves the nest for college. Readers familiar with today's Batman will be intrigued by one of the first stories in which Bat-mite, a pesky pixie with interdimensional powers, tries to make a love connection between Batwoman Kathy Kane's niece, Bat-girl Betty Kane, and Robin. The Kanes-and Bat-mite-disappeared in the mid-60s, clearing the way for Barbara Gordon, a medical librarian, to step in as Batgirl. Other stories feature Clay-face, the Joker, the Penguin, the Riddler, Poison Ivy, and Catwoman. Batman, Batgirl, and Robin each get a solo adventure. There are short biographies of heroes and villains as well as short features on how Bat-technology works.

The development of Russia was different from that of the rest of Europe. The natural poverty of geographical conditions made it extremely difficult to construct an effective regime, and a &#34;patrimonial&#34; state arose in which the country was conceived as the personal property of the tsar. The book describes the evolution of this regime, and analyzes the political behaviour of the principal social groupings, peasantry, nobility, bourgeoisie and clergy, and accounts for their failure to stand up to the increasing absolutism of the tsar. Only the intelligentsia were able to make such a stand, and the book shows how in countering this challenge, Russia developed into a bureaucratic police state.</p><p>14 1.5-hour cassettes<b>Richard Pipes&nbsp;</b>was for many years a professor of history at Harvard University.

A. Gill traverses the Atlantic to become the freshest chronicler of American identity in recent memory. With a fiery temper, a sharp-tongued wit, and an insatiable curiosity to figure out what makes more than 300 million of the world&#x2019;s population tick, Gill traces the history and logic of our nation&#x2019;s habits, collecting wild stories and startling facts along the way. From Colorado, where he meets a local vegeta�tion expert and learns which flowers were in Poca�hontas&#x2019;s nuptial bouquet, to Kentucky, where he visits the Creationist Museum and drinks moonshine with a hog farmer, and to Harlem, where he misses a turn and stumbles into the wrong barbershop for a once-in-a-lifetime haircut, Gill embarks on a tour of not only the nation&#x2019;s landscape but also its psyche, playing adventurer, philosopher, statistician, and raconteur all at once. In inimitable fashion he explains why pressing a button in a Manhattan elevator means entering a social contract of American etiquette and inverting conventional hierarchies of space; why browsing through Playboy centerfolds becomes the perfect litmus test for a generation&#x2019;s political views; and how Hollywood is the metaphysical marketplace for movies, the place where Americans are sold on American romance and taught how to dream the American dream. <br> <br>Weaving together a tapestry of historical erudition and outrageous anecdotes, Gill ultimately captures the scope and spirit of a nation that started off as a conceptual experiment and became a political, sci�entific, and cultural fortress. This humorous and revelatory book shows us why we are who we are by transforming ordinary experiences into extraordinary lessons and promising to never let us look in the mirror the same way again.</p><p><b>A.A.

His name is Valentine Michael Smith, and he is destined to become a freak, a media commodity, a scam artist, a searcher, a sexual pioneer, a neon evangelist, a martyr, and finally, a messiah. <br>This novel became not only the bible of the love generation, it managed to transcend the science fiction genre to achieve the status of a modern classic; or, as others put it, Heinlein's earthly divine comedy. <br>Robert A. Heinlein's novel was published in 1961 in a cut, or censored, version. This Blackstone audiobook is read from the Ace paperback version published in 1987 and thus is the as published version. The full, uncut text was not made available until 1991.</p><p><i>Stranger in a Strange Land</i>, winner of the 1962 Hugo Award, is the story of Valentine Michael Smith, born during, and the only survivor of, the first manned mission to Mars. Michael is raised by Martians, and he arrives on Earth as a true innocent: he has never seen a woman and has no knowledge of Earth's cultures or religions. But he brings turmoil with him, as he is the legal heir to an enormous financial empire, not to mention <i>de facto</i> owner of the planet Mars. With the irascible popular author Jubal Harshaw to protect him, Michael explores human morality and the meanings of love. He founds his own church, preaching free love and disseminating the psychic talents taught him by the Martians. Ultimately, he confronts the fate reserved for all messiahs.<p> The impact of <i>Stranger in a Strange Land</i> was considerable, leading many children of the 60's to set up households based on Michael's water-brother nests. Heinlein loved to pontificate through the mouths of his characters, so modern readers must be willing to overlook the occasional sour note ("Nine times out of ten, if a girl gets raped, it's partly her fault."). That aside, <i>Stranger in a Strange Land</i> is one of the master's best entertainments, provocative as he always loved to be.

In 1939 he sold his first science fiction story to <i>Astounding</i> magazine and soon devoted himself to the genre.<p>He was a four-time winner of the Hugo Award for his novels <i>Stranger in a Strange Land</i> (1961), <i>Starship Troopers</i> (1959), <i>Double Star</i> (1956), and <i>The Moon is a Harsh Mistress</i> (1966).

I can hear the engines of the cars above me on Hammersmith Bridge. Rush hour. I smell the city, the fading fragrance of spring, of dew on the leaves. Then I plunge into the cold water and it closes over my head. I strike out with my arms, gathering speed as the receding tide carries me with it. Despite being more than thirty miles away, the sea sucks the river toward it. My body has not forgotten the tug of the tide; it&#x2019;s as if I never left the sea, although it&#x2019;s over twenty-five years since I last bathed in the Atlantic.</p><p>Finally I reach the girl.</p><p>The river is dragging her along. It wants to own her. It&#x2019;s intent on breaking down her body into its constituent parts, severing her hopes from her fears, ripping the smile from her lips, and cutting off her future.</p><p>She&#x2019;s sinking into the muddy waters. I dive and pull her closer by her hair. I manage to catch hold of a slender, slippery upper arm. I tighten my grip and gather my breath for the coming struggle. Salty, ice-cold water floods into my mouth. The Thames wraps me in its embrace.</p><p>Her face, with eyes the color of the wintry sea, floats toward me. She&#x2019;s pinching her nose shut with the fingers of one hand, as if she had merely jumped into the lukewarm, chlorine-tinged water of a swimming pool. In fact, she has fallen from a boat, one of the many pleasure craft carrying tourists along the Thames. After climbing onto the second-highest bar of the boat&#x2019;s railings, the girl had tilted her face to catch the May sunshine when a chance wave slapped against the hull, raising the stern and tipping the whole boat forward. The girl didn&#x2019;t make a sound, but her eyes were brimming with boundless curiosity.</p><p>From Hammersmith Bridge we watched her fall&#x2014;the kissing couple, the beggar in the threadbare tuxedo, and me.</p><p>The beggar jumped up from his &#x201c;turf,&#x201d; a piece of cardboard in a sunny spot against the suspension bridge&#x2019;s green rail. &#x201c;Oh my God!&#x201d; he whispered. The couple turned to me. Neither they nor the beggar moved a muscle&#x2014;they simply stared at me. So I clambered over the green cast-iron railing, waited until the small figure surfaced below me, and jumped.</p><p>The girl is gazing at me with more trust and hope than a man like me deserves. Of all the people in this city who might have been in a position to rescue her, it had to be me.</p><p>I lace my arms around her frail, wet body. The girl kicks out, and her feet catch me in the head and mouth. I swallow water, I breathe in water, but I still manage to make myself buoyant and push for the surface. The world grows louder again. The May wind feels mild on my wet face; the waves send spray into my eyes. I turn onto my back to form a bobbing, watery cot and haul the girl onto my chest so she can breathe and look up at the blue sky. In this position, we float down the Thames past brick facades and wooden boats moored to the muddy banks.</p><p>The kid splutters and gasps for air. She seems to be about four or five. I don&#x2019;t have a clue about children, not even my own.</p><p><i>Samuel. Sam. He&#x2019;s thirteen and he&#x2019;s waiting for me. He&#x2019;s always been waiting for me. Forever. I was never there.</i></p><p>I start humming Charles Trenet&#x2019;s <i>La Mer, </i>that majestic hymn to the beauty of the sea. Scraps of the French lyrics bubble up into my mind. I haven&#x2019;t spoken my native tongue since I was eighteen, but now it comes flooding back.</p><p>As I sing, I gradually sense that the girl&#x2019;s heart is settling into a calmer rhythm. I feel her little lungs pumping and her trust piercing the film of water and fear between us. I hold her tightly and use one arm to propel myself on my back toward the bank, where there is a small jetty. My clothes are sodden. I kick my legs like a frog and my ungainly one-sided crawl makes me look like a one- armed bandit.</p><p>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s going to be okay,&#x201d; I whisper. I can hear Eddie&#x2019;s voice clearly inside my head, as if she were there, whispering in my ear: &#x201c;You&#x2019;re not a good liar, Henri. It&#x2019;s one of your greatest qualities.&#x201d;</p><p>Eddie is the best thing that never happened to me.</p><p>My shoulder bumps into one of the floating barrels supporting the jetty. There&#x2019;s a ladder within reach. I grab the girl by the waist and lift her up, pushing her tiny feet higher and higher until she finds a handhold and wriggles out of my grasp.</p><p>I follow her. I climb out of the river; pick up the exhausted child, who is desperately trying not to weep; and carry her past yellow, red, and gray houses back to Hammersmith Bridge. The girl entwines her arms around my neck and buries her face in my shoulder. She&#x2019;s as light as a feather, but she gets heavier and heavier as I walk along, pursued by the nagging thought that I really need to hurry now to meet Sam. I must go to him. I must. My son&#x2019;s waiting for me at his school.</p><p>The same couple is still standing there on the bridge, holding each other close. The woman looks at me in a daze, her eyes wide and shiny. The kohl swooshes at their corners and her beehive hairstyle remind me of Amy Winehouse. Holding up his smart- phone, the man keeps saying, &#x201c;I don&#x2019;t believe it. I don&#x2019;t believe it, man. You actually got her. That was unbelievable.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Were you only filming or did you think of calling for help?&#x201d; I hiss at him.</p><p>I put the girl down. She doesn&#x2019;t want to let go, and her tiny hands cling to my neck before finally slipping through my wet hair.</p><p>All of a sudden I feel very weak and lose my balance. Incapable of standing upright, I stagger out into the road. The little girl screams.</p><p>Something big and hot sweeps into view over my shoulder. I see a twisted face through glass. I see a black bonnet, glinting in the sunlight, swipe my legs from under me. And then I see my own shadow rising at breakneck speed from the asphalt to meet me, and hear a noise like eggshells breaking on the rim of a china cup.</p><p>The pain in my head is a thousand times more intense than the agonizing twinge you feel when you bite into an ice cream. Everything around me goes quiet. Then I melt. I melt into the ground. I sink down, faster and faster, as if I were plummeting into a deep black lake beneath the asphalt.</p><p>Something is gazing up at me expectantly from the lake&#x2019;s murky depths. The sky is receding all the time, its arc farther and farther overhead. I see the girl&#x2019;s face up above, staring sadly at me as I seep into the stone with her oddly familiar eyes, which are the color of the sea in winter. Her oceanic eyes are now indistinguishable from the lake above me. I merge into the lake and its waters claim my body. Women and men cluster around the shores, obscuring the last patch of blue sky. I hear their thoughts inside my head.</p><p><i>The woman in the Mini tried to swerve out of the way. </i></p><p><i>Dazzled. She must have been dazzled. She didn&#x2019;t see him.</i></p><p><i>From the way he stumbled out into the road, I thought he must be drunk.</i></p><p><i>Is he alive?</i></p><p>I&nbsp;can make out the beggar in the threadbare tuxedo as he pushes the other people aside, offering me a fresh glimpse of the sky&#x2014;the never-ending, beautiful sky.</p><p>I close my eyes. I&#x2019;ll rest for a while and then get up again and continue on my way. I can just about make it there on time.

In this intimate biography, he takes us into the private life of an amazingly talented star whose unpredictable behavior and brash temperament often led the author to joke that he was &#34;a dreadful man,&#34; but who was nonetheless capable of genuine kindness and compassion. Sanders was undeniably a remarkable character As a young man in the Argentine, he shot a man in a duel. While living in California, he was offered the lead in the Broadway production of South Pacific after spending $5,000 to make a record of himself singing &#34;Some Enchanted Evening&#34; and sending it to Rodgers and Hammerstein, only to turn the role down. Always obsessed with escaping taxes, he turned his life into a continual worldwide excursion and lost over a million dollars in speculative business deals. Aherne recalls Sanders&#39; brief, stormy and often hilarious marriage to Zsa Zsa Gabor, his long and happy marriage to Benita Colman, his sad deterioration and tragic death. A Dreadful Man is a splendid examination of a complex and fascinating personality. At the same time, it is a touching and extraordinary book about the friendships in a group of exceptionally gifted, talented and charming people: Sanders, mercurial, quixotic and moody; Benita Hume, Ronald Colman&#39;s widow, who eventually married Sanders; and Brian Aherne himself, not to mention a cast of equally distinguished players, who move through this brilliant narrative and those remarkable, lively and fascinating letters with wit and con brio.</p><p></p><h2>Migraine: Understanding A Common Disorder (expanded and updated)</h2><p>In recent years the bestselling <i>Awakenings</i> and <i>The Man Who Mistook His Wife for a Hat</i> have received great critical acclaim, but Oliver Sacks's readers may remember that he began his medical career working with migraine patients. In this new edition of <i>Migraine</i>, he returns to his first book and enriches it with additional case histories, new findings, and practical information.<br><br>For centuries physicians and migraineurs have been fascinated by the visual hallucinations, or auras, which often precede a migraine and which are similar to those induced by hallucinogenic drugs or deliria. In a remarkable new chapter, illustrated with startling full-color paintings by migraine sufferers, Dr. Sacks draws on recent advances in chaos theory and neural simulation to describe these "hallucinatory constants" and what they reveal about the working of the brain.<br><br>Another important addition to the 1992 edition discusses newly developed drug therapies for migraine, as well as alternative, nondrug approaches.

With The Gospel-Driven Life he turns from the crisis to the solutions, offering his recommendations for a new reformation in the faith, practice, and witness of contemporary Christianity. This insightful book will guide readers in reorienting their faith and the church&#39;s purpose toward the good news of the gospel. The first six chapters explore that breaking news from heaven, while the rest of the book focuses on the kind of community that the gospel generates and the surprising ways in which God is at work in the world. Here is fresh news for Christians who are burned out on hype and are looking for hope.</p><p>When did the good news become just good advice?<br><br>Christianity doesn't work as just a moral philosophy or code of ethics. It makes sense only when it is built upon the foundation of the gospel, the good news. The simple message that God has done everything he requires to reconcile sinners to himself is not just the church's slogan, but its lifeblood.<br><br>In this candid and hopeful book, Michael Horton challenges us to reorient our faith and our practice toward the transformative, Christ-centered gospel--both in the church and in the world.<br><br>"Mike Horton has once again hit the nail on the head. With engaging clarity he demonstrates that the gospel is not just for non-Christians; it's for Christians too. In compelling ways he shows that the gospel doesn't just ignite the Christian life; it's the fuel that keeps Christians going every day. Horton's book is a flavorsome reminder that in order for Christians to make a difference in this world, we must be driven by something otherworldly--namely, the gospel."--Tullian Tchividjian, pastor of Coral Ridge Presbyterian Church and author of <i>Unfashionable</i> <br> <br>"In this timely and refreshing work Michael Horton invites Christians to step off the treadmills we have fashioned and to rest fully in the gospel, which announces what God has graciously granted in the person and work of his son, Jesus Christ our Savior."--Ken Jones, pastor, Greater Union Baptist Church, Compton, California<br><br>"Michael Horton is one who understands the time. In <i>Christless Christianity</i>, Horton diagnosed the evangelical dilemma. In <i>The Gospel-Driven Life</i> he provides the solution. More than a fad, a twelve step program, or a forty-day challenge, Horton reminds us that the gospel is the everyday brick and mortar of a life built on the promise of eternal life in Jesus Christ. Before you read another book, read this one."--Anthony Carter, lead pastor, East Point Church, East Point, Georgia, and author of <i>On Being Black and Reformed</i>If the news is big enough, it can change your world.<br><br>Think of the news stories that have rocked our nation. Men on the moon. Victory in war. Celebrity deaths. These are nothing compared to the magnitude of the news of what God did in Jesus Christ. <br><br>Distinguished from all religions and philosophies of life, the Christian faith is, at its heart, "good news." The church originates, flourishes, and fulfills its mission as that part of God's world that has been redeemed and redefined by this strange announcement that seems foolish and powerless to the rest of the world.<br> <br>This book explores the greatest story ever told and the surprising ways in which God is at work, gathering a people for his feast in a fast-food world.</p><h2>Straw Men</h2><p>The slaughter of sixty-eight patrons at a crowded fast-food restaurant in Pennsylvania, the killing of a California teenager, and other horrific, seemingly unrelated events hold the clues to a lethal network of fear known as The Straw Men. Original.</p><p>Michael Marshall is a full-time writer. His novels include &#39;The Straw Men&#39;, &#39;The Lonely Dead&#39; and &#39;Blood of Angels&#39;, and he also writes short stories and screenplays. Two of his earlier novels written under the name of Michael Marshall Smith, &#39;Spares&#39; and &#39;One of Us&#39;, have been optioned by major Hollywood studios. He lives in North London with his wife and their son and two cats.Marshall's debut thriller, which is essentially two seemingly independent stories that meet in the middle, takes its time hooking readers. But once the complex and disparate plot lines meld, this expansive work demands the readers attention. In Dyersburg, Mont., narrator Ward Hopkins, attempting to make sense of the accident that killed his parents, discovers a note and videotape that lead him to believe their lives (and deaths) were not as they appeared. Meanwhile, the abduction of 14-year-old Sarah Becker renews the search for a serial killer who scalps his victims, embroiders their names into sweaters using their hair and then delivers the clothing to the victims parents. As Ward and his CIA buddy slowly unravel the mystery surrounding Wards parents, FBI agent Nina Baynam and former LAPD homicide detective John Zandt search for the elusive killer. Their paths cross when a series of connections is made between the victims and a bizarre cult known as The Straw Men. Marshall's book is filled with pages of uninterrupted description, which, while compelling, doesn't make for fast reading. But, to borrow a cliche, the devil is in the details. Thats certainly the case with this novel, whose graphic scenes of child abuse and dismemberment depict humankind at its most evil.<br>Copyright 2002 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>The Lays of Beleriand (The History of Middle-Earth, Vol. 3)</h2><p>The third volume that contains the early myths and legends which led to the writing of Tolkien&#39;s epic tale of war, The Silmarillion. This, the third volume of The History of Middle-earth, gives us a priviledged insight into the creation of the mythology of Middle-earth, through the alliterative verse tales of two of the most crucial stories in Tolkien&#39;s world -- those of Turien and Luthien. The first of the poems is the unpublished Lay of The Children of Hurin, narrating on a grand scale the tragedy of Turin Turambar. The second is the moving Lay of Leithian, the chief source of the tale of Beren and Luthien in The Silmarillion, telling of the Quest of the Silmaril and the encounter with Morgoth in his subterranean fortress. Accompanying the poems are commentaries on the evolution of the history of the Elder Days.

While at first glance the work looks reassuringly familiar and well within the traditional bounds of the genre, Rickard's methodology is anything but conventional. All of the images are appropriated from Google Street View; over a period of two years, Rickard took advantage of the technology platform's comprehensive image archive to virtually drive the unseen and overlooked roads of America--bleak places that are forgotten, economically devastated and abandoned. With an informed and careful eye, Rickard finds and decodes these previously photographed scenes of urban and rural decay. He rephotographs the machine-made images as they appear on his computer screen, framing and freeing them from their technological origins. As Geoff Dyer has commented on the work, "It was William Eggleston who coined the phrase 'photographing democratically, ' but Rickard has used Google's indiscriminate omniscience to radically extend this enterprise--technologically, politically and aesthetically." A limited-edition monograph of "A New American Picture" was published by White Press/Schaden in 2010; upon publication, it was named a best book of that year by "Photo-Eye" magazine, and quickly went out of print. This edition brings Rickard's provocative series, including more than 30 new images, to a wider audience.<br>Doug Rickard (born 1968) studied American history and sociology at University of California, San Diego.

Never in his life had he seen a river before--this sleek, sinuous, full-bodied animal, chasing and chuckling, gripping things with a gurgle and leaving them with a laugh, to fling itself on fresh playmates that shook themselves free, and were caught and held again." Such is the cautious, agreeable Mole's first introduction to the river and the Life Adventurous. Emerging from his home at Mole End one spring, his whole world changes when he hooks up with the good-natured, boat-loving Water Rat, the boastful Toad of Toad Hall, the society- hating Badger who lives in the frightening Wild Wood, and countless other mostly well-meaning creatures. Michael Hague's exquisitely detailed, breathtaking color illustrations on almost every generous spread--along with Kenneth Grahame's elegant, delightfully old-fashioned characterizations of the animals--make this book a wonderful read-aloud.

But until now, we have known only half the story. With the end of the cold war, decades of secrets have been exposed, bringing with them a remarkable opportunity: the unmasking of the true heroes and villains behind one of the most exciting races in history.</p><p>At the center of this exhilarating, fast-paced account are Wernher von Braun, the camera-friendly former Nazi scientist who led the American rocket design team, and Sergei Korolev, the chief Soviet designer and former political prisoner whose identity was a closely guarded state secret. These rivals were opposite in every way, save for one: each was obsessed by the idea of launching a man to the Moon. Korolev told his wife, "In every century men were looking into the sky and dreaming. And now I'm close to the greatest dream of mankind."</p><p>In attempting to fulfill this dream, Korolev was initially hampered by a budget so small that his engineers were forced to repurpose cardboard boxes as drafting tables. Von Braun, meanwhile, was eventually granted almost limitless access to funds by an American government panicked at the thought that their cold war enemy might take the lead in the exploration of space. Korolev, whose family life was destroyed by his long sentence in the Gulag, was constantly aware that any false move would finish his career or even his life. His rival, on the other hand, enjoyed remarkable celebrity in America and was even the subject of a 1960 biopic.</p><p>In this extraordinary book, Deborah Cadbury combines sheeradventure and nail-biting suspense with a moving portrayal of the space race's human dimension. Using source materials never before seen, she reveals that the essential story of the cold war is a mind-bending voyage beyond the bounds of the Earth, one marked by espionage, ambition, ingenuity, and passion.</p></p><p><p>Deborah Cadbury is the highly acclaimed author of several books, including <em>Dreams of Iron and Steel, The Lost King of France,</em> and <em>Terrible Lizard</em>. She has also won numerous international awards as a television producer for the BBC. She lives in London.</p>*Starred Review* Cadbury traces the development of rockets and spaceflight from German experiments before World War II to the manned moon landings, telling the story in layperson's language (though with a fine glossary appended) and in the process providing powerful biographies of the two outstanding designers, Wernher von Braun and Sergei Korolev. Korolev began as a supervisor of the efforts of German technicians captured during and after the war but later achieved outstanding results with his own designs by launching <i>Sputnik</i> and the first manned orbital flights. Von Braun's history included winking at the use of slave labor but also a succession of breakthroughs that led to the historic day in July 1969 when Neil Armstrong stepped out on the moon. Both Soviet and U.S. programs were plagued with failures and outright disasters that Cadbury graphically though evenhandedly describes, and Korolev literally worked himself to death. The true monument to both designers is the last two generations of manned spaceflight. Appealing to everyone from the generation who listened in high school to the early launches to high-school students today who want a keen-sighted view of the spacefaring past, this outstanding volume is likely to be one of the standards on its subject for years to come. <i>Roland Green</i><br><i>Copyright � American Library Association.

The reticule settled on Kal Skirata within a narrow imaginary band level with his eyes and the indentation at the base of his skull; a perfect cranial vault shot, the ideal for instant incapacitation. Scorch could see the Mandalorian&#x2019;s mouth moving as he spoke to Walon Vau. <br><br><i>Yeah, it&#x2019;s getting like downtown Keldabe around here. It&#x2019;s not as if I don&#x2019;t like the guy. But . . . <br></i><br>Sergeant Vau&#x2013;and he would <i>always </i>be Sergeant Vau, civilian or not&#x2013;was the nearest Scorch had to a father. Vau and Skirata seemed to be deep in conversation, both talking at once while they stared down at the ferrocrete surface of the parade ground, no eye contact at all. It was a weird thing to be doing at daybreak. <br><br>&#x201c;I thought you said you could lip-read,&#x201d; Sev said, munching on a handful of spiced warra nuts. <br><br>&#x201c;I can, but he&#x2019;s not making sense.&#x201d; <br><br>&#x201c;Maybe they&#x2019;re talking <i>Mando&#x2019;a.</i>&#x201d; <br><br>&#x201c;I can lip-read <i>Mando&#x2019;a </i>just fine, <i>mir&#x2019;sheb . . .</i>&#x201d; <br><br>&#x201c;You&#x2019;d think they&#x2019;d have the sense to wear their buckets and use the internal comlink.&#x201d; <br><br>&#x201c;Maybe it&#x2019;s nothing confidential.&#x201d; Scorch could smell the pungent spice on the nuts from across the room. &#x201c;Look, you know what happens when you stuff your face with those things. You get indigestion and wind. And I&#x2019;m not going to put you over my shoulder and burp you.&#x201d; <br><br>Sev belched. &#x201c;You&#x2019;ll miss me when I&#x2019;m gone.&#x201d; <br><br>&#x201c;Make yourself useful and take a look, will you?&#x201d; <br><br>Sev made a long, low rumbling noise at the back of his throat, finished the handful of nuts, and sighted up with his own Deece. He was a sniper. He spent even more time staring through optics than Scorch did. <br><br>&#x201c;They&#x2019;re reciting something,&#x201d; he said at last, and leaned his Deece against the wall again to sit on his bunk and resume munching. &#x201c;They&#x2019;re both saying the same words.&#x201d; <br><br>&#x201c;Yeah? And?&#x201d; <br><br>&#x201c;Don&#x2019;t know. Can&#x2019;t make it out.&#x201d; <br><br>For as long as Scorch could remember, Skirata and Vau had been at loggerheads about everything from tactics and how to motivate troops to the color of the mess walls, sometimes to the point of fistfights. But the war seemed to have softened their outlook. There was no affection between them&#x2013;not as far as Scorch could see&#x2013;but something kept them together as brother warriors, tight and secret. <br><br>Neither of them needed to be here. Vau&#x2019;s bank raid&#x2013;and they didn&#x2019;t talk about that, no sir&#x2013;had probably netted millions. They were men with a mission, driven by something Scorch didn&#x2019;t quite understand. <br><br>He cranked up the magnification. But it didn&#x2019;t help. &#x201c;Maybe they&#x2019;re having a really boring conversation.&#x201d; <br><br>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s <i>names,</i>&#x201d; said Sev at last. &#x201c;They&#x2019;re reciting names.&#x201d; <br><br>Scorch sighted up again, transfixed. &#x201c;How old is Skirata?&#x201d; <br><br>&#x201c;Sixty, sixty-one, something like that.&#x201d; <br><br>&#x201c;What&#x2019;s that in clone years?&#x201d; <br><br>&#x201c;Dead.&#x201d; <br><br>It was a sobering thought, and Scorch wondered why it hadn&#x2019;t struck him that way before. He&#x2019;d never worried about getting old. He never thought he&#x2019;d survive, for all Delta Squad&#x2019;s general bluster that the Separatist hadn&#x2019;t been born who could kill them. <br><br>&#x201c;You think the crazy old barve is going to find his magic cure?&#x201d; he asked. <br><br>Sev tossed a nut in the air and caught it in his mouth. &#x201c;For what?&#x201d; <br><br>&#x201c;Our premature exit from this life. He is always talking about it.&#x201d; <br><br>Sev rumbled again. &#x201c;I still reckon he killed Ko Sai. And I still reckon he got her research, and that&#x2019;s why he killed her, to shut her up. So yeah, I&#x2019;d bet on him finding a way to stop us aging so fast.&#x201d; <br><br>Scorch suspected that Vau was as deeply involved in the death of Kamino&#x2019;s renegade cloner as Skirata; he was still fiercely loyal to Vau, because the man was the reason Delta were all still alive today, one of a handful of squads that had survived intact since the Kamino days. Vau raised <i>survivors. </i>&#x201c;You&#x2019;re not going to mention that to Zey, are you, Sev?&#x201d; <br><br>&#x201c;Nah. I hate giving him sleepless nights.&#x201d; <br><br>&#x201c;But if Sergeant Kal&#x2019;s got Ko Sai&#x2019;s research, why hasn&#x2019;t he started dishing out the cure? It&#x2019;s been nearly six months since he gave you her head.&#x201d; <br><br>&#x201c;You make it sound like a birthday present,&#x201d; Sev said. &#x201c;Maybe he can&#x2019;t make some of the formula work. Or he&#x2019;s just milking the Republic for all he can get before he bangs out with his stash.&#x201d; <br><br>&#x201c;Kal wouldn&#x2019;t leave without his precious Nulls.&#x201d; Scorch turned to look at Sev and met a raised eyebrow. &#x201c;Would he?&#x201d; <br><br>&#x201c;If they deserted, would you shoot them?&#x201d; Sev asked. <br><br>Scorch shrugged, trying to look disinterested, but the idea of putting a round through a brother clone didn&#x2019;t sit well with him. The Nulls were Skirata&#x2019;s adopted sons, too, his precious little boys even if they were grown men&#x2013;<i>big </i>men, dangerous men&#x2013;and if any barve so much as looked at them the wrong way, Skirata would have his guts for garters. <br><i>Even us. <br></i><br>&#x201c;We wouldn&#x2019;t have to,&#x201d; Scorch said. &#x201c;You heard all about Palpatine&#x2019;s death squad standing by if we step out of line.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;Don&#x2019;t avoid the question. <i>Would you shoot them if ordered?</i>&#x201d; <br><br>&#x201c;Depends,&#x201d; Scorch said at last.<br> <br>&#x201c;Orders are orders.&#x201d; <br><br>&#x201c;Depends who&#x2019;s giving them.&#x201d; <br><br>&#x201c;The longer this war goes on, the less I feel the Nulls are on the same side as us.&#x201d; <br><br>Scorch knew what Sev meant, but he thought it was a harsh judgment all the same. He couldn&#x2019;t imagine the Nulls siding with the Seps. They were crazy, unpredictable, even Skirata&#x2019;s private army, but they weren&#x2019;t traitors. <br><br>&#x201c;Come on,&#x201d; he said, grabbing his helmet and heading for the doors. &#x201c;Let&#x2019;s see what the old guys are up to. I can&#x2019;t stand the suspense any longer.&#x201d; <br><br>The parade ground was a platform edged with a low retaining wall and a border of manicured bushes, all trimmed to regulation height&#x2013; there <i>was </i>such a thing, Scorch was certain&#x2013;and it didn&#x2019;t see many parades. More often than not these days, it stood empty except for the occasional impromptu game of bolo-ball. The two veteran sergeants stood in the center of it with heads slightly bowed, oblivious of the commandos approaching. <br><br>But Skirata was never really oblivious of anything. Nor was Vau. They had eyes in their backsides, those two. Scorch still hadn&#x2019;t worked out how they&#x2019;d managed to keep such a close eye on their respective training companies back in Tipoca City. To a young clone, they&#x2019;d seemed like omniscient gods who could not be deceived, evaded, or outsmarted, and they still came pretty close now. <br><br>Scorch could hear the mumbling rumble of low voices. It had a sort of rhythm to it. Yes, they were reciting a list. Now that he could hear, he caught sounds he recognized. <br><br><i>Names. <br></i><br>They <i>were </i>reciting names. <br><br>Sev was the first to hesitate. He caught Scorch&#x2019;s elbow. &#x201c;I don&#x2019;t think we should interrupt them, <i>ner vod.</i>&#x201d; <br><br>Skirata turned slowly, lips still moving, and then Vau looked up. <br><br>&#x201c;You want to join in, <i>ad&#x2019;ike</i>?&#x201d; Vau said kindly, and he was not a kindly man. &#x201c;Just commemorating brothers gone to the <i>manda. </i>You forgotten what day it is?&#x201d; <br><br>Scorch had, although it should have been etched in his memory. Seven hundred and thirty-six days ago, all ten thousand Republic commandos had been deployed to Geonosis with the rest of the Grand Army at zero notice, a scramble to board ships that left no time for farewells to their training sergeants. Of the ten thousand men who shipped out, only five thousand had come back. <br><br>Scorch felt like a fool. He knew what the two sergeants were doing now, and why: they were reciting the names of fallen clone commandos. It was a Mandalorian custom to honor dead loved ones and comrades by repeating their names daily. He wondered if they went through all those thousands every single day. <br><br>&#x201c;You didn&#x2019;t memorize every name, did you, Sarge?&#x201d; Sev asked. <br><br>&#x201c;We remember every lad we trained, and we always will,&#x201d; Skirata said quietly, but Scorch saw that he kept glancing down at a datapad clutched in his hand. Five thousand names&#x2013;plus those killed after the Battle of Geonosis&#x2013;was an impossible feat of memory even for Skirata&#x2019;s devotion. &#x201c;The rest ...we only need a little prompting.&#x201d; <br><br>Scorch couldn&#x2019;t now name half the squads in his bat...</p><h2>Don&#39;t Let the Turkeys Get You Down</h2><p>Dedicated to Whom It May Concern, <i>Don't Let the Turkeys Get You Down</i> is Sandra Boynton's hilarious commentary and 150 full-color drawings identifying the ubiquitous turkey's distinguishing characteristics and most common habitats.

First the townspeople send a brave knight. He never returns. Then they send an army of trained warriors. They get destroyed.

Mr. Egielski lives in Milford, New Jersey, with his wife and son.</p>*Starred Review* PreS-Gr. 2. Children are easily drawn to stories about St. Francis and his powerful, easy ability to connect with the Earth's creatures, and Egielski's retelling of a famous St. Francis legend, the wolf of Grubbio, is an entertaining, pitch-perfect gem. The first line--"A long time ago, in Italy, when knights battled and kings and queens lived in grand castles"--sets a fairy-tale tone, which fits the story beautifully. There isn't an off step in the brief, descriptive text; the succinct, winsome passages are perfectly paced for read-alouds, and they nimbly share the storytelling with Egielski's detailed illustrations. Printed on speckled paper resembling parchment scrolls and bordered with details from Italian art history, the rich artwork extends the words' fine balance between earnest, fantasy conventions and gleeful humor in scenes filled with grand architecture and costumes and wholly expressive characters. Frequent, wordless spreads show the wolf, more schoolyard bully than terrifying beast, easily dispatching knights and soldiers (he's shown lounging in his armor-strewn lair, picking his teeth with a knight's spear), before St. Francis tames him "with love," and the town lives peacefully ever after. For more about St. Francis for the age group, suggest Robert Kennedy Jr.'s <i>Saint Francis of Assisi</i> (2005) and Margaret Hodges' <i>Brother Francis and the Friendly Beasts</i> (1991). <i>Gillian Engberg</i><br><i>Copyright � American Library Association.

Reprint. 40,000 first printing.</p><p>The catalog of lovers, husbands, and tryst partners that runs throughout this 560-page biography of Pamela Churchill Harriman is astonishing in itself: Randolph Churchill (the besotted son of Sir Winston), Edward R. Murrow, Elie de Rothschild, Averell Harriman ... What&#39;s more astonishing is that along the way Pamela Digby Churchill Hayward Harriman managed to find time to become an accomplished globe-trotting socialite, a mother, a leading fundraiser and den mother for the Democratic Party, and, today, the American Ambassador to France. Sally Bedell Smith sought out Pamela Harriman&#39;s most far-flung associates and detailed everything from her subject&#39;s cosmetic surgeries to her fudged studies at the Sorbonne to produce this exhaustive work, and though the subject comes across as cold, calculating, and duplicitous, there is a grudging admiration for the century&#39;s ultimate courtesan.In 1994, Christopher Ogden, employed by Pamela Digby Churchill Hayward Harriman to ghost her autobiography, published Life of the Party. When she balked at exposing the spicier side of her career, he went ahead on his own, using her taped interviews, but legally he could quote nothing. Smith, another unauthorized biographer, quotes little from Harriman, written or vocal, for similar reasons, but 400 of her acquaintances cooperated, resulting in a deeply informed and revelatory study. Smith (All His Glory: The Life of William S. Paley) has done further homework in financial and court papers and in the diaries, letters and memoirs of contemporaries. Had it not been for Ogden's preemptive strike, Smith's intensely detailed biography of the least sedate of American ambassadors?British-born Pamela Harriman, now 76, represents the U.S. in Paris?would be even more explosive. Perhaps only in France, where premiers and presidents often have publicly acknowledged mistresses, would she be acceptable, even admired, as an envoy. Bedding her way to wealth and power, the resourceful red-haired beauty wed Randolph Churchill, Leland Hayward and Averell Harriman, filling in the interstices between marriages with Edward R. Murrow (her only unmoneyed lover), Gianni Agnelli, Aly Khan, Elie de Rothschild and other deep-pocketed admirers. Said one observer: "She could make a man, not just in bed. She stretched a man's horizons." Austerity was never her cup of tea, nor was familial loyalty to the children and grandchildren inherited from two American husbands. Her lifestyle, Smith contends, was always based on self-aggrandizement. As a former Hayward wife remarked, "Pam Churchill thought she would marry [Fiat heir] Agnelli, so she became a Catholic on spec." Brushing aside her reputation as grande cocotte, a French friend scoffed, "Everyone has a past. It is who she is today that counts." Photos not seen by PW.

Frozen for decades in a trance-like state, these men and women were given up as hopeless until 1969, when Dr. Oliver Sacks gave them the then-new drug L-DOPA, which had an astonishing, explosive, "awakening" effect. Dr. Sacks recounts the moving case histories of his patients, their lives, and the extraordinary transformations which went with their reintroduction to a changed world.</p><p>It hardly seems fair that so many great doctors are also great writers. Perhaps it's qualities like sensitivity, craft, and dedication that keep physicians like Oliver Sacks in hospitals all day and at writing desks all night; if nothing else, these qualities shine in books like <i>Awakenings</i>. This powerful set of case histories rises above its pathological foundation to find new literary territory, a medical-spiritual synthesis equally stimulating for the mind and the soul. It's no wonder Hollywood producers chose to turn it into a feature film--anyone can see the universal human struggle against bondage and despair in these pages.<p> The sleeping-sickness epidemic of 1918 caused hundreds of survivors to slip into a bizarre rigid paralysis with similarities to advanced Parkinson's disease. These patients, only occasionally able to communicate or move, were nearly all institutionalized for life, their ranks increasing every now and then with similarly afflicted men and women. Sacks came to work at a long-term care facility shortly before the first exciting results with L-dopa and Parkinson's in the late 1960s; his patients soon embarked on dramatic, difficult recoveries from up to 50 years of torpor. He documents their spiritual and medical obstacles with great care to portray their individual personalities, long suppressed but finally released. Though many great doctors are also great writers, few can compare with Oliver Sacks for expressing the relation of medicine to the human spirit. <i>--Rob Lightner</i></p>"One of the most beautifully composed and moving works of our time." --"The Washington Post <br>"Compulsively readable. . . .

His subsequent work&#x2014;five novels, another story collection, and two books of nonfiction&#x2014;continued to bring extraordinary praise and national attention to the writer <i>New York Newsday</i> called a "master."<br><br> In November 2004, Brown sent the nearly completed manuscript of his sixth novel to his literary agent. A week later, he died of a massive heart attack. He was fifty-three years old.<br><br><i>A Miracle of Catfish</i> is that novel. Brown's trademarks&#x2014;his raw detail, pared-down prose, and characters under siege&#x2014;are all here. <br><br> This beautiful, heartbreaking anthem to the writer's own North Mississippi land and the hard-working, hard-loving, hard-losing men it spawns is the story of one year in the lives of five characters&#x2014;an old farmer with a new pond he wants stocked with baby catfish; a bankrupt fish pond stocker who secretly releases his forty-pound brood catfish into the farmer's pond; a little boy from the trailer home across the road who inadvertently hooks the behemoth catfish; the boy's inept father; and a former convict down the road who kills a second time to save his daughter.<br><br> That Larry Brown died so young, and before he could see<i> A Miracle of Catfish</i> published, is a tragedy. That he had time to enrich the legacy of his work with this remarkable book is a blessing.</p><p>When Larry Brown died suddenly in 2004 at 53, he left a nearly finished sixth novel, <i>A Miracle of Catfish</i>, that revisits several of his favorite themes: fatherhood, alienation, and loneliness. Shannon Ravenel, Brown's Algonquin editor, had the daunting task of trimming the enormous manuscript to manageable size, almost impossible for a responsible editor to do without the help of the author. Brown's prolix, rambling style is at times mesmerizing and at times--just rambling. Brown's notes at the end show us where the story might have gone, but it does not suffer for being unfinished. Larry Brown definitely knew where he was taking his reader, and Ravenel helped him along. <p> Consideration of the fatherhood theme centers around a man known only as "Jimmy's Daddy," an unregenerate, wretched human being and an ignorant, violent drunkard. His preoccupations, view of women, and treatment of Jimmy might be seen as caricatures if we didn't know that such people actually exist. Another father, with a much more interesting story, is Cortez Sharp, a farmer in the low hills near Oxford, Mississippi, for nearly fifty years. He has a daughter, Lucinda, living "with a retard" in Atlanta. The man is a layabout artist who suffers from Tourette's Syndrome, which makes Cortez think that he is simply retarded. Cortez has a deep, dark, guilty secret which is eventually revealed, but the two things that we know about him from the beginning are that he is terribly lonely and is stocking a pond he just had dug with catfish--thousands of catfish. Two minor players are Cleve, a muderous black man who is an occasional employee of Cortez's and Tommy, who delivers fish to stock Cortez's pond and owns Ursula, the Mother of all Catfish. Jimmy is the hapless nine-year-old who suffers at the hands of his daddy, and comes to the attention of Cortez who tells him--initially--to get off his property. All of these lives intersect in unexpected ways and are changed by the encounters. Brown writes hell-bent-for-leather in a style uniquely his own which carries the reader along, into landscapes interior and exterior. <i>--Valerie Ryan</i></p>When writer Larry Brown died suddenly in 2004 at the age of fifty-three, he left behind an almost completed sixth novel that embodies all the talent and tenacity of his hard-driven life. Set in the low hills just outside Oxford, Mississippi, very close to Larry Brown's own home, <i>A Miracle of Catfish</i> is the story of one year in the lives of four men and one little boy. Connecting and suffusing their stories is Brown's brooding contemplation of fatherhood. There is Cortez Sharp, a farmer with a terrible secret and a newly dug pond he is stocking with catfish. Tommy Bright, from Arkansas, has a fish-stocking business he's all but gambled away. Cleve, a black neighbor down the road, has a daughter who's taken up with a man so unworthy he doesn't deserve to live. Little Jimmy, whose daddy gave him a go-kart, has the bad luck to have been born to that daddy, a man beyond redemption.<br> <br> And then there's Ursula, the mother of all catfish, who has her own secret life near the bottom of Cortez's pond.<br> <br> In <i>A Miracle of Catfish</i>, Larry Brown's trademark clarity and tenderness, humanity and humor, have been honed to a brilliant edge.

She has spent more than twenty-five years in television and now performs to sold-out audiences across the country.Best known for her marriage to Jim Bakker and work developing several Christian television networks, Messner here offers her philosophy on life in a breezy, conversational fashion. She's now happily remarried, but still bears the scars of the scandal with Bakker, who went to prison over charges of mail fraud; their marriage culminated in divorce and financial ruin. However, she exults in being a survivor and believes that others, especially women, can benefit from her advice. Messner discusses makeup, love of shopping, weight loss, children and more. Only a few pages examine the end of her marriage to Bakker and the scandal over criminal activities, though Messner asserts her and her ex-husband's innocence: "We lost PTL and Heritage USA because another minister propagated lies about us and our ministry, and the media saw an opportunity for a huge story and ran with it. As hard as we tried, we did not have the money to fight the case against us. The lies had somehow become truth in people's minds...." She goes from past to present, recalling her childhood and her work building several Christian televangelical networks. Some of her advice is sound. "Be careful," she warns. "The people I most trusted have most betrayed my trust in them. And believe it or not, it was usually over money... money is soon gone, and you have lost something so much more important than money when you lose a good friend." Other times, she's silly and frivolous, apparently unintentionally: "I think almost every woman should own a wig. It makes every day a good hair day." Fans of Tammy Faye will relish this book, admiring her ability to endure tough times. However, many readers may find it hard to take her seriously.<br>Copyright 2003 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>The People Vs.

Barack Obama INTRODUCTION<p></p> <br><br> THE CASE AGAINST THE PRESIDENT<p></p> <br>On November 4, 2008, Barack Obama was elected president of the United States. It was a time of hope. It was a time of restoration. Three months later, President-elect Obama stood at the podium before cheering throngs, and he raised his right hand. &#x201c;I, Barack Hussein Obama, do solemnly swear that I will faithfully execute the office of President of the United States, and will to the best of my ability, preserve, protect and defend the Constitution of the United States.&#x201d;<br> <br>Fast-forward five years. White House press secretary Jay Carney takes to the podium in the press briefing room. The Obama administration, now in its second term, has been plagued by scandal after scandal:<br> <br>� On September 11, 2012, the American consulate in Benghazi, Libya, was attacked by terrorists after months of desperate pleas for more security from Ambassador Christopher Stevens and his staff; Stevens and three other Americans were murdered as American forces remained mere hours away. Now State Department witnesses from Libya have testified that higher-ups at the department tried to stifle them from speaking with Congress.<br> <br>� The IRS has admitted that its nonprofit division targeted conservative groups in the years leading up to Obama&#x2019;s reelection effort; further evidence showed that conservative nonprofits were subjected to costly audits.<br> <br>� The Associated Press has revealed that the Department of Justice had secretly obtained months&#x2019; worth of call logs from its reporters. A few days later, reports emerged that the Department of Justice had obtained a warrant for Fox News reporter James Rosen&#x2019;s personal emails and tracked his movements at the State Department.<br> <br>� Within a few days of that, Congress sends a letter to the secretary of the Department of Health and Human Services, Kathleen Sebelius, asking why she had solicited donations from nonprofit organizations to push Obamacare&#x2014;the same organizations responsible for directly implementing Obamacare and therefore subject to HHS oversight.<br> <br>� At virtually the same time, Republican lawmakers send a letter to the Environmental Protection Agency asking why the EPA has forced conservative groups to pay fees for Freedom of Information Act requests while simultaneously waiving those fees for liberal groups.<br> <br>� In early June, former Booz Allen Hamilton employee Edward Snowden, who worked with the National Security Agency, reveals that the NSA PRISM program is tracking all American phone calls. Soon, revelations emerge that the NSA collects &#x201c;nearly everything a user does on the Internet.&#x201d; Snowden says that the government has the ability to collect your keystrokes as they appear.<br> <br>Facing down this cornucopia of political horror, Carney peers through his MSNBC glasses and begins to speak. Carney has already become infamous for spewing gobbledygook at the press&#x2014;so infamous that the left-leaning parody site The Onion prints a mock op-ed by Carney playfully titled &#x201c;Well, Time to Go Out in Front of a Bunch of People and Lie to Them.&#x201d;1<br> <br>On this day, July 22, President Obama is preparing to relaunch another failed attempt at economic mumbo jumbo, a desperate try at shifting the narrative from the bevy of scandals. Unprompted, Carney spouts that thanks to &#x201c;some phony scandals that have captured the attention of many here in Washington only to dissipate, there has not been enough attention paid, in the President&#x2019;s view, to this central idea that we here in Washington ought to be doing everything we can to help the middle class. . . .&#x201d;2<br> <br>Phony scandals. All phony scandals.<br> <br>A few hours later, President Obama himself repeats the &#x201c;phony scandal&#x201d; meme. &#x201c;With an endless parade of distractions, political posturing and phony scandals, Washington has taken its eye off the ball. And I am here to say this needs to stop. Short-term thinking and stale debates are not what this moment requires,&#x201d; Obama intones.<br> <br>What, exactly, made these scandals &#x201c;phony&#x201d;?<br> <br>According to the administration, these scandals are phony because they say so. According to the White House, White House&#x2013;initiated investigations had shown that President Obama didn&#x2019;t personally engage in any of them. Though the White House still hasn&#x2019;t revealed President Obama&#x2019;s whereabouts during the seven-hour Benghazi attacks, Obama, his investigative team assured us, did everything necessary to save the men in harm&#x2019;s way. And Secretary of State Hillary Clinton assured us that while there was negligence, there was no need for firings&#x2014;for, after all, &#x201c;what difference, at this point, does it make?&#x201d; Meanwhile, Secretary of the Treasury Jack Lew told Fox News that there was &#x201c;no evidence&#x201d; that the White House was involved with improper targeting&#x2014;as though absence of evidence were evidence of absence, especially given the fact that the investigators were from the Obama administration itself. Attorney General Eric Holder lied to Congress about targeting the Fox reporter, then somehow got away with claiming it wasn&#x2019;t a lie at all. Director of National Intelligence James Clapper did the same with regard to the NSA&#x2019;s surveillance programs. Sebelius and the EPA didn&#x2019;t even bother making excuses for their actions.<br> <br>All of this was nobody&#x2019;s fault. Wrongdoing, if it existed at all, took place at the individual level. Low-level staffers were responsible. Mistakes were made. We don&#x2019;t know what happened, but we&#x2019;ll initiate an investigation. We can&#x2019;t comment on pending investigations, even if we control them. These are not the droids you&#x2019;re looking for. Move along.<br> <br>Only nobody ever got fired, many people got promoted, and all of those mistakes by all of those low-level staffers just happened to synchronize precisely with the wishes of the White House. Every day, Obama&#x2019;s knights were ridding him of meddlesome priests&#x2014;but that was all just a big coincidence.<br> <br>There&#x2019;s only one problem with Obama&#x2019;s routine: it&#x2019;s not just a lie, it&#x2019;s a crime.<br> <br>The Obama administration has become a full-fledged criminal enterprise. Riddled up and down with executive branch appointees engaged in high crimes and misdemeanors, the administration has not merely failed to cleanse itself, it has incentivized ambitious bureaucrats throughout the government to take action on behalf of the Obama political agenda.<br> PROSECUTING THE OBAMA ADMINISTRATION<p></p> <br>The crime of conspiracy has typically been defined at the state level as the agreement of two or more people to commit a crime. There is little question that some of the crimes of the Obama administration have been coordinated at the highest level, as the evidence will show. But when it comes to huge organizations, conspiracy has historically been tough to charge. That&#x2019;s because large organizations rarely have direct chains of command&#x2014;and in an organization as enormous and classified as the United States executive branch, tracing such chains of command becomes nearly impossible.<br> <br>Which is not to say that legal responsibility does not exist. In 1946, the U.S. Supreme Court legally established the principle of &#x201c;command responsibility&#x201d;&#x2014;the idea that a commander bears responsibility for the actions of his subordinates during times of war.3 As the commander in chief, President Obama bears responsibility for the acts of his subordinates, particularly with regard to crimes against Americans under the auspices of war.<br> <br>That would be difficult to prove in a court of law. What isn&#x2019;t difficult to prove is that the Obama administration is a quasi-criminal syndicate, a top-down system in which policies are decided at the highest levels, signals are sent, and low-level bureaucrats receive and implement them.<br> <br>In 1970, in an attempt to curb organized crime in general and the mafia in particular, Congress passed the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act, also known as the RICO Act. The goal of RICO is to make it easier for prosecutors to cast the net in indictments, placing evidence in &#x201c;the broader context in which the crime was committed, along with the pattern of conduct that led up to the crime,&#x201d; according to Professor Samuel Buell of the Duke University School of Law.4 In other words, it was designed to fill a loophole in the law&#x2014;the problem of plausible deniability, in which the man at the top can foist responsibility off on his subordinates (or plausibly call everything under the sun a &#x201c;phony scandal&#x201d;).5 RICO, according to former Department of Justice director of research Donald J. Rebovich, provides the prosecutors the ability to &#x201c;abandon a reliance on discrete statutes. Instead, they can prosecute patterns of criminal acts committed by direct and indirect participants in criminal enterprises.&#x201d;6<br> <br>RICO provides that any person who is part of an organization that commits any two on a list of crimes can be prosecuted for racketeering, fined up to $25,000, and sentenced to twenty-five years in prison per count. Those charges include murder, kidnapping, gambling, arson, robbery, bribery, extortion, dealing in obscene material, dealing in drugs, bribery, counterfeiting, embezzlement, extortionate credit transactions, wire fraud, witness tampering, retaliating against a witness, victim, or informant, and dozens of other crimes&#x2014;some of which, as we&#x2019;ll see, have been committed by the Obama administration. RICO, according to its language, was supposed to be &#x201c;liberally construed to effectuate its remedial purpose.&#x201d;7 The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit has described the list of predicate offenses under RICO as &#x201c;exhaustive.&#x201d;8<br> <br>Politicians aren&#x2019;t immune to RICO charges. When Detroit mayor Kwame Kilpatrick conspired with contractor Bobby Ferguson, he was charged with RICO Act violations. Together, Kilpatrick; his father, Bernard Kilpatrick; and Ferguson faced forty-five charges, including racketeering, extortion, bribery, and mail fraud. As the Detroit Free Press reported, &#x201c;The most weighty of the charges was the one levied under the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organization Act (RICO), a 1970 law that was initially designed to combat organized crime but has since been used in several public corruption trials. In the Detroit case, prosecutors charged the group they called the &#x2018;Kilpatrick Enterprise&#x2019; engaged in a pattern of criminal activity&#x2014;one of the requirements of RICO&#x2014;that included at least two criminal acts.&#x201d;9<br> <br>While prosecutors routinely use RICO to go after criminal enterprises, RICO extends beyond criminal prosecution to include civil suits. That means that you can sue a criminal enterprise, and receive triple your damages&#x2014;you don&#x2019;t have to wait for President Obama&#x2019;s corrupt Department of Justice to do the work they&#x2019;re being paid not to do. The victims of Bernie Madoff, for example, have targeted Madoff&#x2019;s associates under RICO. (It&#x2019;s worth noting that Bernie Madoff&#x2019;s fraud pales in comparison to the federal government&#x2019;s fraudulent social programs.) As the Supreme Court has written, the goal of civil RICO filings is to deputize the public to enforce the law against corruption, to make citizens into &#x201c;?&#x2018;private attorneys general&#x2019; on a serious national problem for which public prosecutorial resources are deemed inadequate.&#x201d;10 Plaintiffs in civil RICO actions must show by a &#x201c;preponderance of the evidence&#x201d; that defendants bear guilt. That&#x2019;s different than &#x201c;beyond a reasonable doubt&#x201d;&#x2014;it&#x2019;s a much lower burden of proof.<br> <br>To bring a RICO case, plaintiffs must be able to show that an &#x201c;enterprise&#x201d; exists, and that there is a &#x201c;pattern&#x201d; of criminal activity. To show that an &#x201c;enterprise&#x201d; exists, plaintiffs must demonstrate that there is a &#x201c;continuing unit that functions with a common purpose.&#x201d; That unit, in this case, can&#x2019;t be the entire federal government or the entire executive branch&#x2014;it has to be separate and apart from the normal functioning of those organizations. That&#x2019;s a problem in and of itself, given that with the massive growth of government, it&#x2019;s arguable whether the executive branch has become a quasi-criminal syndicate, no matter who runs it (when is the last time a president didn&#x2019;t oversee massive corruption and criminality?). But if a pattern of criminal activity is shown by members of a group, and that activity always benefits their common interest, it will be difficult to argue that there was no &#x201c;enterprise&#x201d; in place.11<br> <br>Now, prosecuting an administration as a criminal syndicate presents certain challenges&#x2014;first and foremost, the fact that the Department of Justice is responsible for administering the RICO statute. That puts any RICO prosecution in the hands of the Eric Holder Justice Department, which is to say, it kills any chance of real consequences for the Obama administration. But that&#x2019;s not to say that Holder shouldn&#x2019;t investigate. Under the law, the attorney general is supposed to investigate whenever there are &#x201c;reasonable grounds to believe there has been a violation of criminal law.&#x201d; That&#x2019;s an incredibly low bar.12<br> <br>But let&#x2019;s take this out of the hands of Eric Holder. Assume for a moment that President Obama&#x2019;s administration were in the private sector. He&#x2019;d be in court so fast it would make his head swim. Were Obama a civilian in the business world he so despises, and were he stripped of his executive privilege, there is no doubt that not only would many of his bureaucrat lieutenants find themselves in jail, but that he would be hard pressed to prove his innocence. Either he would be culpable of presiding over a criminal enterprise, participating in obstruction of justice and becoming an accessory after the fact, or he would be the kingpin.<br> THE ANOINTED ONE<p></p> <br>The first secretary of the Treasury, Alexander Hamilton, worried in Federalist No. 70 that if America were to embrace a council of executives, that would leave room for virtually any wrongdoing to go unpunished. Nobody would be able to be held accountable, because there would be too many people with conflicting areas of responsibility.13 Accountability was the hallmark of the founding ideal. As Harry Truman would later put it, the goal was for the buck to stop on the president&#x2019;s desk.<br> <br>That vision went out the window with the rise of Woodrow Wilson and the administrative government. Wilson believed that the legislative branch was an obstacle to change (sound familiar?) and that the presidency represented the collective will of the people. But the president couldn&#x2019;t do everything on his own. He needed helpers. Lots of helpers. America, he wrote, should be run not by millions of citizens, but by &#x201c;hundreds who are wise.&#x201d; Those hundreds would not be selected by the people. They would be selected by the president. &#x201c;Self-government,&#x201d; Wilson scoffed, &#x201c;does not consist in having a hand in everything, any more than housekeeping consists necessarily in cooking dinner with one&#x2019;s own hands.&#x201d;14 This vision would usher in a glorious age in which the Constitution was scrapped and the executive branch experts would run things.15<br> <br>It took a hundred years, but Wilson got his wish: a president with almost ultimate power and a huge cadre of agents to implement it, a horde of servants so huge that the president can always place blame with a low-level flunky. The number of agencies of the federal government has increased exponentially; there are literally thousands of agencies and subagencies of the federal government, not to mention the nearly 2.8 million civilian employees of the executive branch.16 In 1900, there were approximately 300,000 such employees.17<br> <br>That&#x2019;s a lot of people to hide behind.<br> <br>And President Obama is an expert at hiding from his own crimes. That&#x2019;s doubly true, given the bizarre...</p><h2>I Am the cheese</h2><p>To commemorate the 20th anniversary of its publication, Alfred A.

Though the alpha watch wasn't due to begin for another ten minutes, she wasn't at all surprised to see several key bridge officers already hard at work at their consoles, which hummed and beeped agreeably. </p><p> Commander Ernst Roget, her executive officer, turned toward her in the command chair and favored her with a reserved smile. "Captain on the bridge," he said, vacating the seat for her. </p><p> Heads turned toward Blaylock, distracted momentarily from their vigilance. These were good officers, science and engineering specialists all, and she hated allowing command protocol to interfere with their work, even momentarily. She often envied them their single-minded dedication to discovery. How ironic, she thought, to have allowed her command responsibilities to come between her and the very thing that had brought her out to the galactic hinterlands in the first place: the pursuit of pure knowledge. </p><p> Blaylock nodded a silent <i>as you were,</i> and each crewmember quickly returned to the work at hand. She took her seat and sipped her coffee. </p><p> Commander Cortin Zweller approached Blaylock from the science station on the bridge's starboard side. His thick shock of white hair was belied by the boyish twinkle in his eye. During the nearly four months he had served as chief science officer, he had proven to be a valuable member of the <i>Slayton</i> team. Though by no means a brilliant researcher, Zweller was well-liked by the other science specialists, an administrator apparently gifted with the good sense not to step on the toes of his better-trained subordinates -- unless absolutely necessary. </p><p> "The anomaly still seems to be hiding from us," Zweller said. "So far, at least." </p><p> Blaylock sighed, disappointed. The <i>Slayton</i> had last made long-range sensor contact with the subspace anomaly eight days previously, but had turned up nothing since. Several weeks before that, the Federation's Argus Array subspace observatory had detected intermittent but extremely powerful waves of subspace distortion that seemed to be coming from the region of space for which the <i>Slayton</i> was now headed. Unfortunately, the phenomenon had neither lasted long enough -- nor repeated itself regularly enough -- to reveal much else. </p><p> How wonderful it would have been, Blaylock reflected, to have discovered an entirely new physical phenomenon while en route to a dreary diplomatic appointment on gods-forsaken Chiaros IV. But Blaylock knew it would be just her luck for the anomaly to return briefly -- and then vanish forever -- while she and her crew were preoccupied with the tedium of galactic politics. </p><p> The captain turned toward Lieutenant Glebuk, the Antedean helmsman. In the year since Glebuk had come aboard, Blaylock had assiduously avoided asking the galley replicators to create sushi, one of her favorite foods. Glebuk, who was essentially a two-meter-tall humanoid fish, was notably edgy about such things. </p><p> Like most of her kind, Glebuk would have found the rigors of interstellar travel intolerable but for the effects of the cortical stimulator she wore on her neck. Its constant output of vertigo-nullifying neural impulses kept her from lapsing into a self-protective catatonic state during long space voyages. Despite this handicap -- or perhaps because of it -- Glebuk was one of the best helm officers Blaylock had ever worked with. </p><p> "What's our present ETA at the Chiaros system?" Blaylock asked Glebuk. </p><p> The helmsman fixed an unblinking, monocular gaze on the captain and whispered into the tiny universal translator mounted in the collar of her hydration suit. "The Slayton will reach the precise center of the Gulf in approximately fifty-three minutes. We will arrive at the fringes of the Chiaros system some six minutes later." </p><p> Blaylock nodded. <i>Almost the precise center of the Geminus Gulf,</i> she thought with a tinge of awe. <i>Three wide, nearly empty sectors. Sixty light-years across, all together. Nearly two weeks travel time at maximum warp.</i> Even after a decade of starship command, she found it hard to wrap her mind around such enormous distances. </p><p> During the long voyage into the Gulf, Blaylock had had plenty of time to familiarize herself with the region. More than enough time, actually, since so little was actually known about it, other than its size, location, and strategic significance -- or rather its lack thereof. It was well-known, however, that most of its sparse stellar population were not of the spectral types associated with habitable worlds. In the Geminus Gulf, young supergiant "O" type stars predominated -- the sort of suns whose huge mass blows them apart only a few hundred million years into their lifespans -- rather than the cooler, more stable variety, such as the "G" type star that sired Earth and its immediate planetary neighbors. </p><p> But the Geminus Gulf was important in at least one respect; it lay just outside the boundaries of both the Federation and the Romulan Star Empire, and it had yet to come formally into the sphere of influence of either power. Nearly smack in the center of the Gulf's unexplored vastness lay one inhabited world, the fourth planet of the politically nonaligned Chiaros system. Under recently negotiated agreements, neither the Federation nor the Romulans could establish a permanent presence in the Gulf until invited to do so by a spacefaring civilization native to the Gulf. Blaylock was only too aware that her job was to do everything the Prime Directive would allow to obtain that invitation from the Chiarosans, who comprised the only warp-capable culture yet known in the Gulf, and thus were the key to the entire region, and to whatever awaited discovery within its confines. </p><p> <i>Never mind that there isn't any there there,</i> Blaylock thought, absurdly reminded of the 20th-century human writer Gertrude Stein's often-mischaracterized description of an empty region on Earth. </p><p> Settling back into her chair, Blaylock smiled to herself. She had already reviewed the Chiarosan government's preliminary application for Federation membership. Less than two weeks from now, the planet's general population would formally vote on whether to invite in the Romulans or the Federation. Fortunately, since the pro-Federation position was being staunchly backed by the planet's extremely popular ruling regime, it seemed to Blaylock that her mission was already all but accomplished. </p><p> Blaylock therefore felt amply justified in allowing her thoughts to return to the matter of the mysterious subspace distortions -- and their possible causes. Now that they had piqued her curiosity, she couldn't bear the thought of leaving the bridge for a diplomatic conference whose results were already foreordained. </p><p> "Just how important is the captain's presence at this conference?" Blaylock said, turning toward Roget. </p><p> Seated in the chair beside Blaylock's, Roget leaned forward, his mahogany-colored brow wrinkled in evident confusion. "It's crucial, Captain. The natives of Chiaros IV are a warrior people. If you're not there, they're likely to take offense." </p><p> Her exec's discomfiture brought a small smile to her lips. "Don't panic, Ernie. I'm not planning on going AWOL. What I mean is, how important is it that the captain be present with the first away team?" </p><p> Roget appeared to relax at that. Stroking his jaw, he said, "It's not critical, I suppose. You have to remember, though, that the Chiarosans are very hierarchical and protocol-conscious." </p><p> "So I noticed," Blaylock said. "They've planned just about every minute of our itinerary while we're on their planet. And we won't even meet First Protector Ruardh until our third day on the planet. It's all just lower-level functionaries until then." </p><p> "'When in Rome,' Captain," Roget said. </p><p> "I agree. Therefore I've decided I'm staying aboard the Slayton until you finish up the preliminary business with the first away team. That'll give me at least another full day here on the bridge before I have to join you down on the planet." </p><p> Roget smiled knowingly. "You want to keep looking for those subspace distortions yourself." </p><p> Blaylock didn't smile back. Roget needed to know that she was deadly serious. "There's more at stake here than my scientific curiosity. We already know that the Romulans will have a delegation on Chiaros." </p><p> "That's unavoidable, unfortunately, under the treaties." Roget, too, was no longer smiling. </p><p> "Wherever you find Romulan diplomats, you'll probably also find a cloaked Romulan ship nearby -- certainly up to no good." </p><p> Roget regarded her with a silent scowl. He was giving her <i>the look</i> again. She knew that he had to be thinking, <i>a cloaked Romulan ship that causes intermittent subspace distortions that can be picked up five sectors away?</i> Fortunately, Roget was not one to question her orders in front of the crew. </p><p> <i>Until I find out the answer,</i> she told herself, <i>I'll be damned if I'm off this ship one second longer than I absolutely have to be.</i> </p><p> At that moment, Zweller rose from his station and faced Blaylock, an eager expression on his face. Though he was in his sixties, his unbridled enthusiasm made him appear much younger. </p><p> "Captain?" </p><p> "Yes, Mr. Zweller?" </p><p> "If it's all right with you and Commander Roget, I'd like to be part of the first away team. From what I've read about Chiaros IV, the place could keep a dozen science officers busy for years." </p><p> Blaylock looked toward her exec, who nodded his approval. She turned the matter over in her mind for a moment, then rose from her chair and regarded Zweller approvingly. She liked officers who weren't afraid to show a little initiative. </p><p> "All right, Mr. Zweller. Assemble a few of the department heads in the shuttlebay at 0800 tomorrow. You and Commander Roget will oversee the opening diplomatic ceremonies." </p><p> Zweller thanked Blaylock, then returned to his station to contact his key subordinates. She had no doubt that Chiaros IV would more than justify his scientific curiosity. For a moment, she regretted her decision not to lead the first away team. </p><p> But she had a mystery to solve, and a ship to worry about. <i>Needs must,</i> Blaylock thought, <i>when the devil drives. </i></p><p><i> Or the Romulans.</i><br> </p><p> Sitting beside Roget in the cockpit of the shuttlecraft Archimedes, Zweller finished his portion of the preflight systems checks in less than five minutes. The eight- </p><p> person craft was ready for takeoff even as the heads of the biomedical science, planetary studies, xenoanthropology, and engineering departments took their seats. </p><p> At Roget's command, the triple-layered duranium hangar doors opened, accentuating the faint blue glow of the shuttlebay's atmospheric forcefield. The shuttle rose on its antigravs, moved gently forward, and accelerated into the frigid vastness of space. </p><p> The perpetually sunward side of Chiaros IV suddenly loomed above the <i>Archimedes,</i> presenting a dazzling vista of ochers and browns. Gray, vaguely menacing clouds surged over the equatorial mountain ranges. High above the terminator separating eternal night from unending day, Zweller could see the glint of sunlight on metal -- Chiaros IV's off-planet communications relay, tethered to the planet's narrow habitable zone by a network of impossibly slender-looking cables. Zweller noticed that the portion of the tether that plunged into the roiling atmosphere was surrounded by transitory flashes of light. </p><p> <i>Lightning?</i> he wondered, then looked more closely. <i>No, it's thruster fire. If the Chiarosans didn't compensate somehow for the motions of their turbulent atmo- </i></p><p><i> sphere, that orbital tether wouldn't last ten minutes.</i> </p><p> Zweller took in this vista -- the untamable planet as well as the tenacious efforts of the Chiarosans to subdue it -- with unfeigned delight. </p><p> "Hail the Chiarosans, Mr. Zweller," Roget said, interrupting his reverie. Zweller complied, immediately all business once again. His hail was answered by a voice as deep as a canyon, which cleared the shuttlecraft to begin its descent into the churning atmosphere. The computer received the landing coordinates and projected a neat, elliptical course onto the central navigational display. </p><p> "A pity we can't just beam straight down to the capital," Roget said as the <i>Slayton</i> receded into the distance. </p><p> Andreas Hearn, the <i>Slayton'</i>s chief engineer, spoke up from directly behind Zweller. "Between the radiation output of the Chiarosan sun, the planet's intense magnetosphere, and the clash of hot and cold air masses down there, we can't even get a subspace signal down to the surface -- at least not without the orbital tether relay. I wouldn't recommend trying to transport anyone directly through all that atmospheric hash." </p><p> "Oh, enough technical talk," said Gomp, the Tellarite chief medical officer, who was seated in the cabin's aftmost section. "I want to know what these people are really like. The only things I've seen so far are their official reports to the Federation. Medically speaking, all I can really say about them is that they're supposed to be triple-jointed and faster than Regulan eel-birds." </p><p> "Then I wouldn't recommend challenging them on the hoverball court," Hearn said with a chuckle. </p><p> The <i>Archimedes</i> entered the upper atmosphere. On the cockpit viewer, Zweller watched as an aurora reached across the planet's south pole with multicolored, phosphorescent fingers. Lightning split the clouds in the higher latitudes. Atmospheric friction increased, and an ionized plasma envelope began forming around the shuttle's hull. </p><p> "Gomp makes a good point," said xenoanthropologist Liz Kurlan, as though this didn't happen very often. "All we know about these people so far is what they want us to know." </p><p> "So we'll start filling in those gaps in our knowledge today," Roget said with a good-natured shrug. "That's why we're all here, isn't it?" </p><p> Sitting in silence, he moved his fingers with deliberate precision over the controls. Then the shuttle hastened its descent toward the rapidly approaching terminator, the demarcation line between the planet's endless frigid night and its ever-agitated, superheated sunward side.<br> </p><p> On the <i>Slayton'</i>s bridge, Blaylock heard an uncharacteristic urgency enter Glebuk's voice. "Captain! The anomaly has reappeared!" </p><p> The bridge crew suddenly began moving in double-time. Blaylock was on her feet in an instant. "Location!" </p><p> "Scanning," Glebuk said. </p><p> Ensign Burdick, the young man at the forward science station, beat the Antedean to the answer. "A massive subspace distortion wave-front has appeared...four-point-eight astronomical units south of the planet's orbital plane." </p><p> "Speed?" </p><p> "One-tenth light-speed in all directions. Speed is constant." </p><p> "Transfer the coordinates to the helm," Blaylock said. </p><p> "Coordinates received," acknowledged Glebuk. </p></p><h2>Hirschfeld&#39;s Harlem: Manhattan&#39;s Legendary Artist Illustrates This Legendary City Within a City (Applause Books)</h2><p>Decades before the PBS documentaries, before Bill Clinton, Al Hirschfeld went to Harlem. No artist ever captured Harlem's dangerous highs and bluesy lows like this Master of the Performing Curve. Hirschfeld began his artistic Harlem odyssey six decades ago, charting that legendary New York neighborhood's special rhythms and moods in splashy feverish hues. <i>Hirschfeld's Harlem</i> opens onto a special portfolio of these full-color works, a pictorial essay of the Swing Era. Wynton Marsalis, Quincy Jones, Lena Horne and Harry Belafonte, among a dozen other Harlem artists and critics, supply accompanying commentary, reminiscences and analysis &#x2013; each voice focusing on one portrait.<br><br>Then it's back to Hirschfeld in his signature black and white takes on forty Harlem artists and public figures: Gregory Hines, Duke Ellington, James Earl Jones, Ethel Waters and dozens more &#x2013; all have been caught in the creative act by one of our greatest artists. Each drawing is accompanied by a thumbnail narrative by Hirschfeld about the most famous inhabitants and transients of these fabled streets. <i>Hirschfeld's Harlem</i> opens a picture window into nearly a century of Black American artistry and life.</p><p>"I have been so continuously enchanted with the Harlem I had grown up near and visited my whole life. . .Harlem people just keep on rising above whatever met them at eye level; regardless of the rugged terrain or the economic weather, Harlem residents had their own means of levitation. They performed an art form beyond the Arts, beyond the stage, beyond the Cotton Club. Very real people meeting reality head on and then stubbornly transcending it. Some commentators have made much of the fact that these aren&#x2019;t Hirschfeld's typical performers. Well, they&#x2019;re not on the stretch of Broadway I had covered before or since. But these Harlemites are performers all right. They are in rehearsal for the performance of their lives. It&#x2019;s that grand profound ritual I hope to have captured here." <p>-Al Hirschfeld, January 2003, from his preface, Drawing on Harlem</p>The late great Al Hirschfeld was designated a &#x201c;Living Legend&#x201d; by the Library of Congress. The United States Post Office has issued 15 stamps with Hirschfeld drawings. He is the recipient of two Tony Awards for Lifetime Achievement. His work has been prominently featured in <i>The New York Times</i> for nearly 75 years. He has been represented in exhibitions at major art museums and institutions, including the Smithsonian's National Portrait gallery, The Metropolitan Museum of Art, The Whitney Museum, The Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences and The Museum of the City of New York. His <i>Hirschfeld On Line</i> was published by Applause Books.</p><h2>An Alaska Anthology: Interpreting the Past</h2><p>Alaska, with its Indian, Eskimo, and Aleut heritage, its century of Russian colonization, its peoples&#x2019; formidable struggles to wrest a living (or a fortune) from the North&#x2019;s isolated and harsh environment, and its relatively recent achievement of statehood, has long captured the popular imagination. In <i>An Alaska Anthology</i>, twenty-five contemporary scholars explore the region&#x2019;s pivotal events, significant themes, and major players, Native, Russian, Canadian, and American. The essays chosen for this anthology represent the very best writing on Alaska, giving great depth to our understanding and appreciation of its history from the days of Russian-American Company domination to the more recent threat of nuclear testing by the Atomic Energy Commission and the influence of oil money on inexperienced politicians. Readers may be familiar with an earlier anthology, <i>Interpreting Alaska&#x2019;s History</i>, from which the present volume evolved to accommodate an explosion of research in the past decade. While a number of the original pieces were found to be irreplaceable, more than half of the essays are new. The result is a fresh perspective on the subject and an invaluable resource for students, teachers, and scholars.</p><p>In An Alaska Anthology, twenty-five contemporary scholars explore the region&#39;s pivotal events, significant themes, and major players, Native, Russian, Canadian, and American.

But one special, long-established form of intention and affirmation has been overlooked: the novena. Perennially popular in the Catholic Church, a novena is a nine-day period of prayer for a particular grace or intention, often offered as a supplication to a saint with expertise in a particular area. <b>Novena</b>, a volume that will enchant the eye and touch the soul, traces its history and brings together thirty-six of the best-known novenas. Each is accompanied by a luminous image of its affiliated saint--fiercely beautiful and intensely human--adapted, with a contemporary air, from a traditional prayer card; by a brief discussion of the saint's life and particular specialty; and by instructions on when, and why, to use the novena. <b>Novena</b> is divided into four sections: novenas to the saints, the angels, the madonna (each revealing a different aspect of her personality), and the Divinity. An appendix cross-references specific concerns with appropriate novenas: We learn how the saints themselves transcended such problems as a turbulent youth, a difficult marriage, or abuse. The ideal gift for Easter and Mother's Day, this jewel of a book has year-round bestselling potential.</p><p>The novena (from <i>novem</i>, Latin for "nine") is a prayer for a blessing, repeated nine times a day for nine days in a row, usually offered to a saint. "Generally, the saints are invoked for more material or health-related problems while the angels are invoked for more universal problems or to change a life path. The madonna can be invoked for anything but is most effective for those in distress of the soul, the guilt-ridden, and those troubled by family discord. The novenas directed toward God himself are the most spiritual and intense," write Barbara Calamari and Sandra DiPasqua in the introduction to their beautiful new book, <i>Novena: The Power of Prayer</i>. <p> Illustrated with ravishing color portraits of saints, angels, and the madonna, each novena included in this book is complemented by a short history of the accompanying figure, related dates on the liturgical calendar, and stories about believers who have prayed these prayers. Even if you're not planning to pray a novena, this book is an entertaining and useful reference to one of the most popular prayer traditions in Catholicism. You'll learn, for instance, that St. Paul is the patron saint of both snake bite and journalists. Wonder if there's any connection. <i>--Michael Joseph Gross</i></p><b>Barbara Calamari</b> is a freelance writer who has worked in film and television.

Reprinted hundreds of times in Colonial newspapers, they were perhaps the most widely read source for arguments for freedom of the press, and against arbitrary government power and taxation. Now back in print are the stirring words of those immortal English authors, John Trenchard and Thomas Gordon. This volume offers 42 essays from their enormously influential <b>Cato's Letters</b> and <b>The Independent Whig</b> series originally published in the early 1720s. They inspired our Founding Fathers to strive for American Independence, and they will inspire you. <p> "No one can spend any time in the newspapers, library inventories, and pamphlets of colonial America without realizing that <b>Cato's Letters</b> rather than Locke's <b>Civil Government</b> was the most popular, quotable, esteemed source of political ideas in the colonial period." -- Clinton Rossiter.</p></p><p>The following is from the foreword by Ronald Hamoway. <p> I am most pleased to have been asked to write a brief foreword to a reprinting of David L. Jacobson's edition of <b>The English Libertarian Heritage</b>, a collection of articles excerpted from <b>The Independent Whig</b> and <b>Cato's Letters: Essays on Liberty, Civil and Religious</b>. These essays, authored by John Trenchard and Thomas Gordon and first published as letters in the London press between 1719 and 1723, both reflected and contributed greatly to radical Whig political philosophy in England during the first decades of the eighteenth century and, some fifty years later, were to exercise a profound influence on the arguments put forward by American colonists in their struggles with the British crown. The colonists saw in these writings an impassioned and closely reasoned defense of the priority of personal freedom over political authority and of the principles of limited government, and regarded them with increasing favor as the agitation for a radical break with Great Britain swelled. Indeed, so popular did Trenchard and Gordon's writings become in the colonies immediately prior to the Revolution that selections from The Independent Whig and Cato's Letters were regularly reprinted in the American press. Bernard Bailyn, in his comprehensive study of the intellectual background to the Revolution (<b>The Ideological Origins of the American Revolution</b>) notes that the writings of Trenchard and Gordon, in the minds of the American colonists, "ranked with the treatises of Locke as the most authoritative statement of the nature of political liberty." </p><p> As will be evident to the readers of the selection of letters offered in this edition, the writings of Trenchard and Gordon bear the unmistakable imprint of the political philosophy so forcefully expounded by John Locke in his <b>Two Treatises of Civil Government</b>, published some thirty years earlier. In letter after letter the authors vigorously maintain that Englishmen possess certain rights, both by virtue of their constitutional heritage and by their nature as human beings, and that among these rights are those of freedom of speech and conscience, and the right to resist oppressive government. In letters 59 through 68 of Cato's Letters particularly, of which Professor Jacobson offers extended excerpts, Trenchard and Gordon advance a theory of government and of inalienable rights that clearly echo Locke's <b>Second Treatise</b>. "All Men are born free," they write. "No Man has Power over his own Life, or to dispose of his own Religion; and cannot consequently transfer the Power of either to any body else. Much less can he give away the Lives and Liberties, Religion or acquired Property of his Posterity, who will be born as free as he himself was born, and can never be bound by his wicked and ridiculous Bargain."</p></p><h2>Greenhouse Gardener's Companion: Growing Food &amp; Flowers in Your Greenhouse or Sunspace</h2><p>An environmentally friendly sourcebook that is actually two books in one, providing everything the gardener needs to know about setting up a healthy growing environment within a sunspace, plus a complete guide to growing flowers, vegetables and herbs in the greenhouse.

More than ever before, 50-plusers are achieving unprecedented levels of physical fitness--sometimes even getting into the best shape of their lives. Studies show that regular exercise really does help you to live longer and more healthily, no matter when you start doing it. Whatever your age, beginning a sound fitness program and consistently following it can help you look and feel fantastic. There's a real upside to turning 50 (and beyond): Just as you know what's important as far as your career, families, and friends go, chances are you are also aware of your strengths and weaknesses. Armed with sound understanding of who you are, you also know what you want from a workout. Should you strive to improve your balance? Are you hoping to alleviate that tightness in your shoulders, while also whittling your waist? Do you love your legs, and want to keep them looking great? Drawing on mature self-knowledge, you can make better-informed choices about how, when, where, and why you exercise. And in turn, you discover smarter, more effective ways to achieve well-being.</p> <p>Consider this book your guide to working out smarter. A smart workout involves a big-picture approach, letting you hone a range of different aspects of fitness. A smart workout also addresses small problems before they become bigger ones. And even if none of your muscles, tendons, ligaments, and joints are feeling strained, sore, or inflexible, exercise can do much to keep them that way.</p> <p>The following pages will give you a comprehensive exercise program, devised with attention to your whole-body anatomy. The first group of exercises focus on flexibility, while the next ones improve your endurance. You'll also find exercises focused on posture and alignment, others that target your range of motion, some that strengthen your core to prevent injury, and others that tone. Performed together, these exercises will improve not only the aesthetics of your body (how it looks), but also its functionality (how it performs). Alongside each major exercise, you will see an illustration showing the muscles challenged. As you work out, visualize the muscles that are being engaged as your body becomes stronger, tighter, and leaner.</p> <p>Your Fitness Tools</p> <p>Some of these exercises incorporate equipment--all reasonably small tools that add variety and challenge to the at home workout. </p><p>Several of the toning exercises call for small hand weights or adjustable dumbbells. You can start with very light, five-pound weights (or even lighter substitutes, such as unopened food cans or water bottles), and then work your way up to heavier ones. </p><p> You will also see two kinds of ball: a small, weighted medicine ball, which is used like a free weight, and a larger Swiss ball. Also known as an exercise ball, fitness ball, body ball, or balance ball, this heavy-duty inflatable ball is available in a variety of sizes, with diameters ranging from 18 to 30 inches. Be sure to find the best size for your height and weight. Swiss balls are excellent fitness aids that really work your core. Because they are unstable, you must constantly adjust your balance while performing a movement, which helps you improve your overall sense of balance and your flexibility. You will see two types of resistance bands, one with handles and one without, both useful in adding resistance to your endurance regime. With each exercise, you will also see a suggested number of repetitions; this number represents a goal to aim for over time, so don't worry if you can't complete so many reps right away. </p> <p>When and Where?</p> <p>At any age, working out can be a struggle--and not necessarily due to the running, lifting, and stretching involved. Rather, we struggle because we have other things going on; our lives are so busy and demanding that it's hard to find time to devote to exercising on a regular basis. That's where the home workout comes in. Once you've made time and space for your workout, find a timetable that works for you. For example, set aside just ten minutes a day, two or three times a week. Often, earmarking a regular time (say, after dinner) and space (the living room, for instance) encourages a consistent workout schedule. Just as you can build up the weight on your dumbbells, so too can you build up the hours per week you spend exercising. As you get more comfortable with the workout, devote more time to it to see faster, better results. You may wish to start by flipping to the section that addresses your goal, whether you want to limber up, tone your arms, or stabilize your core muscles. Dip into this book over time, and don't be afraid to try something new; you may find an exercise that challenges you in a new way or discover that you're weak or strong in an area you never knew existed. Pay attention to what you feel your limits are, and then work toward exceeding them.</p> <p>A New Start</p> <p>We all want to win on the baseball field, keep up with the kids (and maybe even grandkids), and look better than ever--yes, really--in that beautiful pair of designer jeans. At 50+, you are unprecedentedly well-equipped to make it happen. Here's to improving your whole-body anatomy through exercise, and to getting better each and every day.</p></p><h2>General of the Army: George C.

But how do you convince six not-so-sleepy bear cubs to go to bed? Mother Bear, of course, has found a way--with a cozy rhyme for each of them. Once again, beloved author Mem Fox enchants little ones--and their parents--with a tender bedtime story, irresistibly illustrated by Kerry Argent.<br></p><p>MEM FOX is the author of many acclaimed books, including <i>Ten Little Fingers and Ten Little Toes,&nbsp;Possum Magic, Koala Lou, Time for Bed,</i> and, for adults, <i>Reading Magic: Why Reading Aloud to Our Children Will Change Their Lives Forever.</i> She lives in Adelaide, Australia.Mother Bear's six children are balking at bedding down for the winter, but she coaxes them under the patchwork quilt with a clever stratagem: each cub gets a personalized bedtime rhyme. Baxter Bear hears about a pirate adventure: "Raise the skull and crossbones,/ Breathe the salty air,/ Find your treasure, count your gold,/ And sleep without a care!" In Tosca Bear's rhyme, the aspiring princess wears "a crown of diamonds for your head,/ And gorgeous gowns of silken thread." By the end, everyone is fast asleep, and it's up to a stuffed elephant to blow out the bedroom candle. Argent (previously paired with Fox for Wombat Divine) depicts the various bedtime fantasies with gusto in double-page, full-bleed spreads; one tableau showing a cub/hunter holding onto a magnificently rendered tiger by the tail is particularly striking. Following each rhyme, the book returns to the same wide-angle view of Mother and cubs under the quilt, each sleeping cub magically acquiring an accessory from his or her dream (e.g., Baxter sports an eye patch and pirate's hat; Tosca has donned crown and wimple). They look cuddly and warm, curled up together in a room suffused with golden candlelightAitself an enticement, since most children love the idea of a family bed, whether or not their parents do. With its sweetly varied scenarios, this amiable bedtime book offers a little something for everyone. Ages 3-6. (<i>Publishers Weekly</i> )<br><br>PreSchool-Grade 1-A cleverly written bedtime book with very distinct characters, each with its own hibernation-time rhyme. Mother Bear tucks in her six cubs, sending them off on dreamy adventures. Baxter dreams of pirates, Bella of the circus, Winifred of the jungle, Tosca of kingdoms, Ali of divine foods, and Baby Bear of moonbeams. "And all of them slept until spring." The rhymes are well written, and the charming pictures, done in gouache, watercolor, and colored pencil, are full of funny details. When the cubs are in bed waiting to drift off, the room is draped in a yellow hue lit by candle. Dream scenes show distant lands with the youngsters sleeping peacefully in the corners. On the penultimate page, the bears are lined up across the bed in hats or headdresses that represent their particular dreams. A fuzzy, stuffed blue elephant that plays and rests with the bears throughout the book blows out the candle on the final page. A fanciful story that's sure to be popular.

Join Prince Josiah, Princess Gilda, and Prince Selwyn in this third Terrestrian adventure. It&#39;s a race against time as they set out on a dangerous quest to deliver the King s pardon to Adam Everyman, a prisoner condemned to die. Argamor s evil forces are determined for their mission to end in failure. Will the three young people overcome the obstacles, locate the Dungeon of Condemnation, and deliver the royal pardon in time? Book 3 of The Terrestria Chronicles encourages the reader to be a witness for the King.</p><p>Evangelist Ed Dunlop Ed Dunlop has worked in children&#39;s ministries full-time for thirty-two years. As an evangelist, he conducts Kids Crusades in local churches, presents teacher-training seminars, speaks at junior camps, and conducts visualized drug and alcohol awareness programs in public elementary and junior high schools.

His Young Refugee historical series includes Escape to Liechtenstein and The Incredible Rescues. His latest allegory series, the seven title Terrestria Chronicles, is a must-read for any family raising children in today&#39;s society. The author grew up in Phoenix, Arizona. He was raised in a Christian home and was led to Christ as a young child by his mother. He graduated from Pacific Coast Baptist Bible College in 1975 at the age of nineteen, and has served churches in California, Arizona, and Tennessee as assistant pastor and Christian Education Director. He and his family entered full-time evangelism in March of 1988. Ed and his wife, Janice, have three children, Rebecca, Steve and Phillip, and make their home in north Georgia. Ed enjoys canoeing, motorcycling and SCUBA diving. His sons are also certified divers. Ed currently serves as a volunteer diver at the Tennessee Aquarium in Chattanooga, Tennessee, and enjoys feeding the fish, sharks, stingrays and moray eels as groups of school children watch.I was very excited to have a chance to read and review this series of Christian allegory fiction. I am always looking to share with my kids some good books that explain, on their level, the story of what it means to be a Christian and what Jesus did for us by dying on the cross. I have found that in The Terrestria Chronicles! When these books arrived at my home, my 13-year old daughter grabbed them and headed to her room to read them. She s a fast reader and emerged a few days later telling me that she really liked the series and thought that I would, too. It took me a lot longer than a few days to read the series, but they were hard to put down once I got started! The Terrestria Chronicles consists of seven books: - The Sword, The Ring and The Parchment - The Quest for Seven Castles - The Search for Everyman - The Crown of Kuros - The Dragon s Egg - The Golden Lamps - The Great War The series centers around a medieval theme of knights, princesses, castles, etc. Christ is King Emmanuel and the King saves the main character, Josiah, from Argamor (Satan) in the first book. After Josiah is brought into the Kingdom of Terrestria, he is mentored by Sir Faithful and learns what it means to be a son of the King. In each book, Josiah undergoes various trials and learns about faith, the power of his King, and that he cannot rely on his own power to gain success. In the third book, The Search for Everyman, two more main characters are introduced Prince Selwyn and his sister, Princess Gilda. They aid Josiah in his many adventures throughout the rest of the series. One aspect of the books that I really liked was the naming of many of the many peoples and places Sir Wisdom, the Path of Righteousness, the Castle of Faith, Captain Temptation, Woebegone, Discouragement and so on. The series is written for ages 10 and up; some younger readers won&#39;t know the definition of some of these names, but they will get a general understanding of their meanings after reading through these books! The Biblical principles that are taught in this book are sound and I found the allegories in each story helpful in showing me a new way to look at the lessons in the Bible. I don&#39;t want to give any specific examples, but I loved the way that the author takes modern day items and ideas and shows how they are Satan s tools for trying to draw us away from our Lord. We are encouraged over and over again to make Christ our first priority and shown the value of doing so. My favorite book was The Great War which tells the story of the book of Revelation in terms that a child can understand. It is the final book in the series and depicts the greatness of our King, leaving a lasting impression in my mind. I thought about this book for several days afterwards. I plan to read this series with my son as his Bible study during our upcoming school year. We will go through one book monthly, reading and discussing each story and learning more about our King of kings and Lord of lords! I know that he will be enraptured by the fantasy setting and able to identify with Josiah. I have read a modified children s version of The Pilgrim&#39;s Progress with my children, but I believe that The Terrestria Chronicles are much easier to understand while getting many of the same points across to the reader. They are definitely more action-packed! I highly recommend this series for all families ... it will open up a whole new world of understanding of what it means to be a son or daughter of our wonderful King! - Product Review by Kris Price, Assistant to the Publishers, The Old Schoolhouse Magazine, LLC --The Old Schoolhouse Magazine</p><h2>Caught (New York Review Books Classics)</h2><p>During the Blitz, Henry Green served on the London Auxiliary Fire Service, and this experience lies behind <i>Caught</i>, published when the bombing had only recently ended. Like Green, Richard Roe, the hero of this resolutely unheroic book, comes from the upper class. His wife remains at their country estate, far from the threatened city, while Roe serves under Pye, a professional fireman whose deranged sister once kidnapped Roe&#x2019;s young son, a bad memory that complicates the relationship between these two very different men. The book opens as the various members of the brigade are having practice runs and fighting boredom and sleeping around in the months before the attack from the air. It ends with Roe, who has been injured in the bombing, back in the country, describing and trying to come to terms with the apocalyptic conflagration in which he and his fellows were caught, putting into question the very notion of ordinary life.<br><br> <i>Caught</i> was censored at the insistence of its publisher, Leonard Woolf, when it came out in 1943. This is the first American edition of the book to appear as Green intended.</p><p><b>Henry Green</b> (1905&#x2013;1973) was the pen name of Henry Vincent Yorke. Born near Tewkesbury in Gloucestershire, England, he was educated at Eton and Oxford and went on to become the managing director of his family&#x2019;s engineering business, writing novels in his spare time. His first novel <i>Blindness&nbsp;</i>(1926), was written while he was at Oxford. He married in 1929 and had one son, and during the Second World War served in the Auxiliary Fire Service. Between 1926 and 1952 he wrote nine novels, <i>Blindness</i>, <i>Living</i>, <i>Party Going</i>, <i>Caught</i>, <i>Loving</i>, <i>Back</i>, <i>Concluding</i>, <i>Nothing</i>, and <i>Doting</i>, and a memoir,<i> Pack My Bag</i>.<br><br><b> James Wood</b> is a novelist and a staff critic at <i>The New Yorker</i>.

Their stories have long been overlooked in the mythic telling of America's founding, but are crucial to a comprehensive understanding of the fight for independence. Now, the experiences of farmers, laborers, rank and file soldiers, women, Native Americans, and African Americans -- found in diaries, letters, memoirs and other long-ignored primary sources -- create a gritty account of rebellion, filled with ideals and outrage, loss, sacrifice, and sometimes scurrilous acts...but always ringing with truth.</p></p><p><p>Ray Raphael is the author of numerous books, including <em>An Everyday History of Somewhere, The Men from the Boys: Rites of Passage in Male America,</em> and <em>Tree Talk: The People and Politics of Timber.</em> He lives in northern California.</p>California-based writer Raphael (An Everyday History of Somewhere; etc.) offers an accessible study of the American Revolution, as part of a series edited by Howard Zinn, and in the tradition of his A People's History of the United States. Most books on the Revolution focus on generals and kings, although scholars have, in the last two decades, turned some of their attention to the lives of ordinary people. Raphael transforms the best insights of that scholarship into a lively, readable narrative. Yes, kings and generals were important, but it was the people at large who brought about American independence. Even before the war started, ordinary people were involved in protesting British abuses, refusing to consume tea and other British luxury items. Women supported the Revolution by spinning their own cloth (rather than buying it from Britain) and working the farms their husbands left behind when the militia called them to the front. Young men eager to "git" their rights uncomplainingly subsisted on moldy bread while they camped out in the snow, waiting to encounter Redcoats. White colonists weren't the only Americans affected by the war. Abenaki Indians, for example, were paid to fight alongside the rebels. Raphael also shows how many slaves, infected with the freedom-fighting spirit, bid unsuccessfully for their own independence via insurrections, escape and reasoning. Both English and American armies wanted the slaves' loyalties, and the slaves, in turn, believed that if they served the winning side, they would gain freedom. Moving from broad overviews to stories of small groups or individuals, Raphael's study is impressive in both its sweep and its attention to the particular. The book will delight, educate and entertain all Revolution buffs.

When early explorers came to the Gulf Coast, they found the natives not only worshiping the alligator (a 700-foot-long effigy still exists at Grand Lake, Louisiana) but eating alligator meat with relish--a custom taken up by Acadians arriving in the 1760's, who fixed ``cocodrie'' into soups, and continued today as a gourmet delicacy (by 1984 the meat became more valuable than the hides). Glasgow (curator, Louisiana State Museum) traces years of alligator mythology in 19th-century French romances, Victorian poetry, Mark Twain's tall tales, and the stories of Joel Chandler Harris. After the Civil War, he tells us, alligators became a symbol of the Deep South, appearing on the official seal of New Orleans, proliferating by the thousands in roadside gator farms and wrestling exhibitions from Florida to Louisiana, and becoming common town-pets--such as ``Old Hardhide,'' who lived in a caged pool in the center of Ponchatoula, Louisiana, for 21 years. Glasgow's well-told account of the 40-year controversy about the protection of alligators is filled with delicious anecdotes. When Louisiana decided to allow a limited hunting season on alligators (they had become so numerous they were turning up at golf courses, car washes, swimming pools, and carports), the Audubon Society responded with nationally publicized outrage. Louisiana then gave the Society two thousand alligators on the hoof (and in the marsh) that took Society personnel three years to transplant to adjoining states. The magnum opus of America's magnificent reptile. (Two- hundred b&amp;w photographs.) -- <i>Copyright �1991, Kirkus Associates, LP. All rights reserved.</i>This is a historical survey of the effect of the alligator on American literature, folklore, commerce, fashion, economics, and politics. Beginning with Columbus's first alligator encounter, the book traces the various phases of humanity's fascination with the reptile: worship by Native Americans, tourist interest, and finally to the demand for gator meat in "yuppie" America. Quoting heavily from extensive sources, the author highlights the alligator's diverse roles in Brer Rabbit tales, on Sesame Street , as a shirt logo, as a Gatorade symbol, and much more. This lively book is richly illustrated with historic woodcuts and photographs.

It didn&#x2019;t quite wake Josh MacArthur up, however&#x2014; the second sneeze did that, shaking his body so violently that he knocked over the small radio near his sleeping bag. He rolled over and slipped to the edge of the mattress before the third sneeze, trying to bury his face in his arm to muf.e the noise.

Finally he decided to go outside and walk to the clearing, where the moonlight might be strong enough for him to tell the difference between the blue and green pills; it would also give him a chance to relieve himself. He grabbed his jeans from the edge of the cot and pulled them on. Remembering the snakes he&#x2019;d seen during the day, he shook out his boots before putting them on, then took his sweatshirt from the base of his camp bed and went outside. <br>The moist mountain air provoked another sneeze. <br>Josh cursed his sinuses silently and walked over to the open area where they&#x2019;d made a .re the previous eve ning.

He opened the pillbox and sorted through its contents, worried he would sneeze again and spill them in the dirt, where they might be lost forever. Finally he found one he was convinced was&nbsp; green&#x2014;one of the strong&nbsp; ones&#x2014; and popped it into his mouth. <br>He swallowed, grimacing at the bitter taste the pill left in his throat. Then he moved toward the bushes and trees a few yards away to .nd a place to pee. <br>Northwestern Vietnam was not the best place for a man with al�lergies, but MacArthur hadn&#x2019;t considered his body&#x2019;s foibles when he decided on his career as a weather scientist, nor had he thought about it much when he chose his doctoral thesis topic, the impact of rapid climate change on Asian mammals. Vietnam was not only a good place to study his subject; there was actually money available to fund the research, since few scientists wanted to go to such a distant place when there&nbsp; were ample topics in the developed world. These days, one could study the effects of climate change and still sleep in a hotel bed at night. <br>But Vietnam, snakes and all, offered other consolations. The moun�tains and valleys of the north&nbsp; were breathtakingly spectacular. And while they had been greatly affected by the rapid changes in the world&#x2019;s weather that had occurred over the last .ve years, the changes&nbsp; were much more benign, and even bene.cial, than those elsewhere. <br>One of the changes meant it was slightly wetter and warmer in Feb�ruary than it ordinarily would have been just .ve years before. But warmth was&nbsp; relative&#x2014; MacArthur pulled on his sweatshirt and rubbed his hands together, trying to ward off the chill as he looked for a suit�able place to relieve himself. <br>The young scientist had just found a large rock when he heard some�thing pushing through the scrub to his right. He froze with fear. <br>A tiger! <br>Ordinarily they didn&#x2019;t range quite this far west, but they too had suf�fered the consequences of climate change, and&nbsp; were expanding their range. <br>What was he supposed to do? Crouch? Freeze? Run? What had he been told during orientation? <br>Before his mind could supply an answer, he heard another sound, this one farther away. There&nbsp; were two, no three animals moving through the brush. <br>A fourth. <br>They&nbsp; couldn&#x2019;t be tigers. The cats didn&#x2019;t hunt in packs. <br>But this realization didn&#x2019;t comfort him. Something was de.nitely there, moving through the vegetation toward the camp. <br>Thieves? <br>Someone shouted. MacArthur spoke very rudimentary Viet namese, and what he heard didn&#x2019;t match with the words he knew. <br>There was another shout, and then a very loud and strange popping noise, a bang that seemed unworldly. The&nbsp; whole mountain shuddered, then .ashed oddly white. <br>Then came a noise he did recognize, one he&#x2019;d heard long ago as a child, a sound that had .lled his nightmares ever&nbsp; since&#x2014;an automatic weapon began rattling behind him, its sound the steady, quick stutter of death. Another joined in, then another and another. <br>Without thinking, without even looking where he was going, Josh MacArthur took off running in the opposite direction, dodging through the thick brush in the moonlight. <br>Excerpted from larry bond&#x2019;s red dragon rising by Larry Bond and Jim DeFelice.<br>Copyright � 2009 by Larry Bond and Jim DeFelice.<br>Published in November 2009 by Tom Doherty Associates, LLC.<br>All rights reserved.

The previous day she had taken a train from Manchester to Liverpool to catch the ferry to Ireland. The police ascertained that she&#x2019;d boarded for the overnight passage across the Irish Sea but did not disembark.</p><p>On the morning she was to take the ferry, Sara watched the sun emerge above the dreary city, chasing away some of Manchester&#x2019;s November gray. She had not slept since yesterday&#x2019;s unsettling call from her grandmother in Ireland. Sweet milky tea had been abandoned for strong coffee until her whole body vibrated, though she knew it had little to do with the caffeine. She leaned back from the desk that dominated her cramped attic bed-sit and rolled her shoulders to ease the knots of tension along her neck and spine.</p><p>Her Grandmother O&#x2019;Trehy was like a second mother to her. She had left her Irish homeland and moved into the family&#x2019;s London flat for the first fifteen years of Sara&#x2019;s life, when it turned out that Sara&#x2019;s workaholic professor parents were woefully ill equipped to keep up with their energetic infant daughter. Over the years Sara and her grandmother became best friends, tramping through the parks of London while her grandmother recited rich and elaborate tales.</p><p>&#x201c;Sara, do you still have the books I gave you when I left?&#x201d; her grandmother had demanded over the phone the previous day, without so much as a hello.</p><p>&#x201c;Of course,&#x201d; Sara responded, struck by her grandmother&#x2019;s unusual tone. &#x201c;I would never lose those.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Well, get them, right now. There&#x2019;s something you need to see.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Okay,&#x201d; Sara agreed, recalling where she had stashed them. &#x201c;Let me call you back in a few minutes.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;No! No, I&#x2019;m not in Dublin anymore. I&#x2019;m not anyplace where you can call. I&#x2019;m sorry, Sara, to be so abrupt. Please, just do this for me. I&#x2019;ll wait on the line.&#x201d;</p><p>Sara had never before heard her grandmother sound rattled. She fished the two battered boxes out from under her bed, still sealed as they had remained since her arrival at the University of Manchester as a freshman, six apartment moves ago. She tore them open and, one by one, removed the beautiful books of her childhood, placing them on her desk&#x2014;books full of Celtic myths, legends, and faerie tales.</p><p>&#x201c;Got them,&#x201d; she said.</p><p>&#x201c;Good. Now get a knife and pry open the paperboard of their covers.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;What? Grandmother, no. You can&#x2019;t be serious. What&#x2019;s this about?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Please just do as I ask, Sara,&#x201d; her grandmother implored. &#x201c;You&#x2019;re not going to believe me until you see for yourself.&#x201d;</p><p>Sara didn&#x2019;t respond, dismayed at the notion of destroying her treasured books. She picked one up and examined it carefully, touching its broken spine and tattered pages, recalling that her grandmother must have read it to her a thousand times. The cover featured a faerie prince, tall and handsome, holding the hand of a shy human milkmaid. Their love was ultimately doomed, of course, their children to be transformed into swans&#x2014;a story Sara had always found strangely appealing.</p><p>&#x201c;Listen carefully, Sara,&#x201d; her grandmother said, breaking the silence. &#x201c;People came for me, and I barely slipped away. They will come for you, too. They&#x2019;re after those books. There&#x2019;s a whole other set of faerie stories, much older, as old as it gets, hidden in them. You have to look in their covers to understand.&#x201d;</p><p>Sara feared that her grandmother must have fallen into some sort of dementia and tried to humor her. &#x201c;Okay, if that&#x2019;s what you really want.&#x201d; She reluctantly took her knife, cut through the linen covering of the front hard cover of the book, and split apart the interior paperboard. To her surprise, a photograph was hidden inside, showing dense Hebrew script elegantly hanging from an invisible line. It was a portion of an ancient scroll&#x2014;she knew that much from her studies.</p><p>Back when Sara was deciding on where to go to university, she had chosen Manchester because her grandmother had studied there. And just as it had with her grandmother, Sara&#x2019;s major in Middle Eastern Studies led to a graduate program in the region&#x2019;s historic languages, for which she had a flair&#x2014;a trait that apparently ran in the family.</p><p>As dusk gathered outside, Sara, no longer convinced that her grandmother&#x2019;s mind was slipping, hurried to disassemble the covers of all the books while pressing the phone to her ear with her shoulder.</p><p>&#x201c;Grandmother, how did you get these?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;John&#x2014;Dr. Allegro&#x2014;and I . . . were . . .&#x201d; her grandmother stammered, and Sara could practically hear her blushing. &#x201c;We were more than friends when I was in grad school.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;The Dr. Allegro?&#x201d; Sara exclaimed. She knew the name well. Decades ago he&#x2019;d been a professor in her department who had become legendary when he was appointed as the British representative to the international team assembled to study and translate the controversial Qumran scrolls.</p><p>&#x201c;The same,&#x201d; said her grandmother. &#x201c;So I saw the whole debacle unfold from his perspective.&#x201d;</p><p>Sara knew well the events her grandmother referred to. Christened &#x201c;the Dead Sea Scrolls&#x201d; by the press in the 1950s, the ancient documents were discovered accidentally, along with the remains of a shelving system and an index, in secluded man-made caves located in a hotly disputed area on the West Bank near Qumran. It did not take long for it to become clear that the caves held a carefully arranged, cataloged, and preserved collection of works making up the earliest biblical library ever found&#x2014;all the books of the modern Hebrew Bible and the Catholic Old Testament were present.</p><p>Sara&#x2019;s grandmother recounted the initial, exciting days when the team worked well together as they began the slow, methodical process of translation, publishing completed sections as their mandate directed. The early results dazzled scholars and the general public alike, and newspapers worldwide reeled off a steady stream of stories devoted to the discoveries being made. Working from text a thousand years older than any previous source material, the team began to fill in gaps in the Old Testament, places where grammatically or structurally there was obviously a missing word or sentence or paragraph.</p><p>Soon, though, the publications slowed, then stopped altogether. The press started spinning theories that more than missing paragraphs had been found.</p><p>&#x201c;That&#x2019;s when the Vatican began to take over and John became frustrated,&#x201d; Sara&#x2019;s grandmother said. &#x201c;By chance, the UN official in charge of the scrolls was Catholic, and he had them shipped off to a Church facility. Unfortunately, John&#x2019;s letters to another team member were leaked to the press and became headlines.&#x201d;</p><p>Everyone in Sara&#x2019;s class had seen reprints of those reports. Too interesting for the students to ignore, they seemed to recirculate every year. Allegro wrote,&nbsp;<i>&#x201c;I am convinced that if something does turn up which affects the Roman Catholic dogma, the world will never see it.&#x201d;&nbsp;</i>And then,&nbsp;<i>&#x201c;The non-Catholic members of the team are being removed as quickly as possible.&#x201d;</i></p><p>&#x201c;The next year, only four years into the project, John was denied further access,&#x201d; Sara&#x2019;s grandmother continued. &#x201c;And the Vatican took complete and exclusive control of all unpublished scrolls.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Yes, I know all that, Grandma. But the scrolls have been published now.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Look at the photographs again, and the work papers. John brought those to me late one night and helped me hide them. This was shortly after his disbarment.&#x201d;</p><p>Sara spread out the illicit material. She could tell from the translations, meticulously written out in tiny handwriting on onionskin paper, which had also been pressed into the hiding spaces, that the photographs were of significant Qumran scrolls, the books of Enoch and Jubilees. Ostensibly, the scrolls covering these books had been released years ago and were available to anyone online&#x2014;Sara herself had read them as part of her coursework&#x2014;except that large sections of those were missing due to rot or other damage. But not the scrolls shown in the photographs in front of her. These scrolls were virtually intact.</p><p>Sara was aware that early in its history the Vatican had excluded these two books from its Bible, even though they had appeared in older and much longer versions of the Old Testament. As late as the eighteenth century, scholars who argued that those older versions were closer to the original writings, and therefore more accurate, had been vigorously discredited as heretics and even burned alive.</p><p>&#x201c;The book of Enoch was allegedly written by the great-grandfather of Noah, but the Vatican repudiated that notion. They ridiculed it as a fifteenth-century forgery at best, or a second-century satirical work of blasphemy at worst,&#x201d; explained her grandmother. &#x201c;Can you imagine their panic when the copies found among the scrolls dated back to at least 300 bce? Throughout their history they had killed people to suppress the idea that this book was legitimate!&#x201d;</p><p>Sara&#x2019;s grandmother went on to assert that as the third-most-common scroll discovered, Enoch must have been an important part of a version of the Hebrew Bible that existed before the Christian era and very likely the Christian Bible that existed before the dominance of the Vatican.</p><p>&#x201c;The other photographs are of the book of Jubilees. For centuries it was rumored there was a longer and more complete version of Genesis, but no copies were known to exist, at least not publicly, before the scrolls, where Jubilees was also a common book. You see, Sara&#x201d;&#x2014;her grandmother&#x2019;s voice lowered&#x2014;&#x201c;the ones you have are the complete works. The Vatican released only heavily damaged copies. But it was never safe for me to tell anyone about these, and then John died of that heart attack.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;But why would the Vatican care?&#x201d; Sara was making herself a cup of tea.</p><p>&#x201c;That&#x2019;s the point: the fact that they cared so much proves that the content of these photographs must be important. I believe these scrolls may recount the true history of the early days of our world, a time when angels mated with humans against God&#x2019;s orders and produced a hybrid offspring, the Nephilim. Sara, those were the faeries.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Come on, that&#x2019;s absurd!&#x201d; exclaimed Sara. &#x201c;You know as well as I do that ancient origin myths tend to . . .&#x201d; Sara&#x2019;s voice trailed off. She tried again. &#x201c;These stories were probably invented to explain the genesis of . . .&#x201d;</p><p>Her grandmother completed the academic principle for her. &#x201c;The genesis of actual things. And that would mean there were real nonhuman beings in that time, which were endowed with strange powers. But that&#x2019;s almost as absurd.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Almost,&#x201d; echoed Sara, plopping into her desk chair, her tea momentarily forgotten.</p><p>&#x201c;Read the translations. There is detail there that will leave you questioning what you know of the Old Testament. And bring the photographs and work papers to me. Leave tomorrow, and don&#x2019;t fly or use a credit card. Take the ferry to Belfast, then a bus to Derry. I&#x2019;ll meet you there.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Who is after you? What&#x2019;s going on, Grandmother? You&#x2019;re scaring me.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;There&#x2019;s more, Sara. I need to tell you something that even your parents don&#x2019;t know.&#x201d; There was an excruciatingly long pause. &#x201c;I had a twin sister who disappeared while we were in grad school. It must be connected somehow. I know it must. That&#x2019;s why I held on to the photographs and kept them secret for all these years. In case one day I could use them somehow to get her back.&#x201d;</p><p>Sara could her hear grandmother&#x2019;s breathing get ragged.&nbsp;<i>A twin?</i>Sara&#x2019;s grip on the phone tightened, she was shocked and hurt that there was so much her grandmother had kept from her.</p><p>&#x201c;I really didn&#x2019;t know what to do at the time, after a hasty investigation faded out,&#x201d; her grandmother continued. &#x201c;No one listened to me. I knew she hadn&#x2019;t run away. But now I think those who came for me are the ones who took her. I&#x2019;ll tell you everything when I see you. I just can&#x2019;t right now.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Grandmother&#x2014;&#x201d;</p><p>But she had already hung up.</p><p>Sara studied the photographs. These scrolls were much more complete than the fragments that she&#x2019;d seen when she visited the modern home of the Qumran scrolls, the Shrine of the Book in Jerusalem. At the time she&#x2019;d thought the shrine&#x2019;s architectural symbolism merely interesting&#x2014;a parabolic wave frozen into a white dome opposing a monolithic black basalt wall&#x2014;but now it reverberated with meaning. The design represented a prophecy in the scrolls of a war between the sons of light and the sons of darkness, a war in which humans and Nephilim would fight in both factions, along with angels holy and fallen. She wondered if it was a war to come or one that had already been fought.</p><p>Sara had read through the night. With dawn sunlight streaming in her attic bed-sit window, she stood, stretched, and packed the translations and the photographs into a weathered leather satchel. What could her beloved grandmother have gotten herself into? she worried. She pulled some clothes out of a dresser and tossed them into her dilapidated suitcase. Before leaving she surveyed the mess on the desk&#x2014;all her childhood books with their covers split open&#x2014;and vowed to repair them upon her return.</p><p>On the train to Liverpool, as the English countryside rushed by, Sara&#x2019;s concerned mind kept replaying what her grandmother had said. She had trouble enough believing in a God above, let alone in randy angels sneaking out of heaven to have forbidden sex with humans and in their resulting offspring. She withdrew two of her own handwritten pages from her satchel, notes she&#x2019;d made about the hybrid beings in the scrolls and their striking similarity to the magical beings from her grandmother&#x2019;s old stories: pixies, giants, trolls, goblins, merpeople, and faeries.</p><p>The elegant, powerful, and passionate faeries that had populated the tales of her grandmother&#x2019;s Irish homeland were known as the Tuatha D� Danann, a name shortened by the Celts to the Sidhe. Sara loved the fact that the Sidhe were not the shy, diminutive faeries of today&#x2019;s children&#x2019;s books&#x2014;they even married and bore children with the Celts, when they weren&#x2019;t fighting them. The Sidhe ruled the Middle Kingdom, a mostly hidden land that occupied a parallel plane with Ireland and was accessed through magical doorways.</p><p>Sara&#x2019;s favorite of these tales featured enchanted twins, and now she knew why her grandmother&#x2019;s voice was always tinged with sadness when she told them. These were stories of the Goddess Morr�gna, who ruled over both the Celts and the Sidhe. The Morr�gna, a triple-faceted goddess, carried three female aspects, much as the Christian God carried three male aspects&#x2014;the Father, the Son, and the Holy Ghost, what St. Patrick likened to a three-leaf clover. The Morr�gna&#x2019;s aspects were Anann, who remained in the spirit realm as the source of power to the other two, and a set of twin girls who were periodically reborn into the human realm during times of great trouble: the sage Anya and the warrior Aisling.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><b>Chapter 1</b></p><p><i>Kingdom of Meath, Ireland</i></p><p><i>September 1387</i></p><p>Aisl...</p></p><h2>Learn to Play Go, Vol. 4: Battle Strategies</h2><p>CHECK FOR THE 2ND EDITION PUBLISHED 12/12/2011 Volume IV of the award-winning Learn to Play Go series.

It could happen. You have to look somewhere, right?<br>You might have noticed something shooting straight up out of the school. Something the size and shape of, say, a high school student. Arms waving, maybe. Legs kicking&#x2014;count on that. Definitely a human being.<br>Like a rocket, upward until he&#x2019;s a mile above Buena Vista. He hangs in the air for just a moment. Long enough to see and be seen.<br>And then down he goes. Straight down, and not falling, no, shooting downward just as fast as he went up. Bound to kill himself at that speed.<br>You can&#x2019;t believe you saw it. So you keep watching for a moment longer, a few seconds, and look! There it is again! Too far away to be sure whether it&#x2019;s the same kid or a different one. But if you&#x2019;ve got someone with you, you grab them, you say, &#x201c;Look! Is that a person? Is that a kid?&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Where?&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;In the sky! Above the high school, look <i>up</i>, I&#x2019;m saying straight <i>up</i>, you seeing what I&#x2019;m seeing?&#x201d;<br>Down comes the kid, plummeting toward the school.<br>&#x201c;He&#x2019;s got to be dead,&#x201d; you say. &#x201c;Nobody could live through that.&#x201d;<br>And there it is again! Straight up!<br>&#x201c;That&#x2019;s one hell of a trampoline,&#x201d; somebody says.<br>If you noticed it early enough, you&#x2019;d see it repeated about thirty times. And then it stops.<br>Do you think they&#x2019;re dead? I don&#x2019;t know, how could anybody live through that? Should we go up and see? I&#x2019;m not even sure it was people, it could have been, like, dummies or something. We&#x2019;d sound so stupid&#x2014;hey, you got a bunch of kids getting catapulted straight up and then smashing down again? It can&#x2019;t be what it looked like. Maybe we&#x2019;ll see it on the news tonight.<br>Three different people got it on their smartphones. Not the whole thing, but the last five or six, and one guy got fifteen of them. High quality video it wasn&#x2019;t, but that actually made it more credible. All three videos got emailed to people. All three ended up on YouTube.<br>Lots of comments: &#x201c;Fake.&#x201d; &#x201c;Why do people bother making crap like this?&#x201d; &#x201c;You can see that the lighting&#x2019;s different on the flying dummies.&#x201d; &#x201c;Cool. Something new and fun to do with your old G.I. Joe&#x2019;s.&#x201d; The usual.<br>The local news stations aren&#x2019;t all that local. Lynchburg. Roanoke. Staunton. They don&#x2019;t give a rat&#x2019;s ass about Buena Vista&#x2014;the town never amounted to anything even before it died, that&#x2019;s what people think in the big city. If those are big cities.<br>And the footage is so implausible, the flying figures so tiny that it wouldn&#x2019;t look like anything on TV screens. Besides, the fliers were so high that at the top, all you can see is a dot in the sky, not even the mountains. So it&#x2019;s sky, clouds, and a dot&#x2014;makes no sense. Has to be a bird. Has to be a trick of the light. So it doesn&#x2019;t get on the news.<br>But scattered through the world, there are a few thousand people who know exactly what could cause those kids to fly. Straight up, straight down, incredibly fast and yet no news stories about dead kids at a Virginia high school. Oh, yeah, it makes sense to <i>them</i>, all right.<br>It&#x2019;s an act of a god. No, not an &#x201c;act of God,&#x201d; to use the weasel-out-of-it words in insurance policies. Not God. <i>A</i> god.<br>Or at least people used to call them gods, in the old days, when Zeus and Mercury and Thor and Vishnu and Borvo and Mithra and Pekelnik were worshiped wherever Indo-European languages were spoken.<br>Nobody called them gods anymore, but they were still around. Weaker now, because they could no longer pass through the Great Gates that used to carry them from Earth to Westil and back again, greatly magnifying their powers.<br>Only a gatemage could send someone from one place to another instantaneously, but there hadn&#x2019;t been a gatemage since 632 A.D., when the last Loki of the Norse destroyed all the gates on Earth, disappearing through the last Great Gate and closing it behind him.<br>In the North Family compound, only a few miles away from Buena Vista, one of the kids spotted the longest YouTube video only a few hours after it went up on the web, and within twenty minutes the most powerful mages in the family piled into a pickup truck and headed for the high school. They knew it was Danny North who had done it, Danny the son of Odin and Gerd, a boy who had seemed to be drekka until one day he up and disappeared.<br>Now they knew that he hadn&#x2019;t gone as far as they thought. Now they knew he wasn&#x2019;t drekka at all, but a gatemage. And a strong one. Because the video didn&#x2019;t show somebody suddenly appearing in the air, which is how gates usually worked. No, the flying figures could be seen as they moved upward. They were moving fast, yes, but it wasn&#x2019;t instantaneous. They rose into the air, visible the whole way.<br>That meant it wasn&#x2019;t just any gate. It was an attempt at a Great Gate. A spiral intertwining of many gates at once, rising straight up from the surface of the Earth. And even if it only reached a mile into the air, it was one more mile of Great Gate than had existed in nearly fourteen centuries.<br>Here&#x2019;s the thing. Some of the gods on that pickup truck were heading for Parry McCluer High School in order to find Danny North and kill him. Because that&#x2019;s what you <i>did</i> with gatemages&#x2014;they brought nothing but trouble down on the Family, and if the Norths had a gatemage and allowed him to live, all the other Families would unite against them and this time they wouldn&#x2019;t be allowed to survive the war that was bound to start.<br>The Norths had to be able to show Danny&#x2019;s dead body to the other Families&#x2014;it was their only hope of survival. If history had taught them nothing else, it taught them that.<br>But other gods on that truck had a different plan entirely. Danny&#x2019;s father and mother had known perfectly well that Danny was a gatemage&#x2014;it was in hopes of creating a gatemage that Gerd and Alf had married each other back before Alf became head of the Family and took the name Odin. The two most powerful mages in generations: lightmage Gerd with her power over electricity and light; stonemage Alf, with his strange new talent for getting inside the workings of metal machines. Everyone expected a child of theirs to be extraordinarily talented.<br>But Gerd and Alf had studied the genealogical tables and they knew that gatemages, rare as they were, came most often to couples with very different affinities. Like stone and lightning, or water and fire. And never to beastmages. So they hoped. And when Danny showed no sign of being able to do magery, or even raise a clant&#x2014;even the most minimal abilities&#x2014;they hoped even more. Because yes, he might have been drekka, worthless, devoid of power; but he might also be a gatemage, unable to raise a clant because his outself was fragmented into all the potential gates that he could make in his life.<br>And a year ago, when Danny ran away, Thor had used his clant to converse with Danny before he got too far away, and had confirmed that yes, Danny was making gates and yes, Danny finally knew what he was.<br>So the gods on that truck were evenly divided between those intending to murder Danny before he could make a gate and get away, and those determined to enlist his power in the service of the Family.<br>They got there too late. Danny had already made a Great Gate, and the Gate Thief hadn&#x2019;t eaten his gates. Danny had friends&#x2014;Orphans who didn&#x2019;t belong to any Family&#x2014;and some of them had passed through the Great Gate and returned. It made their power irresistible. The Norths were sent home in utter and ignominious defeat.<br>But none of them had been killed. It was a good sign that Danny and his friends had refrained from doing any serious damage. They still might be able to work something out&#x2014;especially if they eliminated the faction of the North family that still wanted Danny dead. Times have changed, Uncle Zog! We can&#x2019;t kill our gatemage, Grandpa Gyish!<br>We have to get Danny to let us pass through a Great Gate! You saw how powerful his friends became&#x2014;a Cowsister took your eagle right out of the sky, Zog! A mere Cobblefriend was able to open up a rift in the ground and swallow our truck! Imagine what Odin will do with his power over metal and machinery, what Gerd will do with electricity, when they pass through a Great Gate.<br>And imagine what the other Families will do to <i>us</i> if Danny lets any of them through a Great Gate before us. No, that&#x2019;s not a reason to kill him&#x2014;how will we even get near him now? He&#x2019;s warned, he&#x2019;s ready, he&#x2019;ll just gate away from us. You know the stories. The winged feet of Mercury, seven-league boots&#x2014;gatemages can be gone before your attack comes close to them. Or they can suddenly appear behind you and kill you before you turn around.<br>Gatemages are slippery! Once they come into their power, you <i>can&#x2019;t</i> kill them. Even if you sneak up on them somehow, passing through a gate heals any wound. We&#x2019;re no threat to a gatemage. We need him&#x2014;alive and on our side. So we have to talk to Danny. Appeal to his family loyalty.<br>And if you can&#x2019;t stop trying to kill him, then we&#x2019;ll have no choice but to put <i>you</i> in Hammernip Hill. For the good of the family.<br>You understand, yes, you do&#x2014;you&#x2019;d do it yourself. There&#x2019;s a gatemage in the world, one who created a Great Gate and wasn&#x2019;t destroyed by the Gate Thief. And that gatemage is our own Danny. He knows us, he grew up among us.

But the only way he could move his stuff back out to his parents&#x2019; house was he needed a car.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Has he ever heard of U-Haul?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;He didn&#x2019;t have that much stu&#x2014;&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Forget I asked.

Don&#x2019;t answer that. But tell me this. And don&#x2019;t lie, Trinetta. Did you pay the insurance like you said you would?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I paid half of it.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;So, if you or Dante got in half of an accident do you realize who could get sued for their whole damn house?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;We both very careful drivers, Ma.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;You sound like a damn fool, Trinetta. You know that?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I&#x2019;ll see you in a few hours.&#x201d;</p><p>I just shake my head and head on back to the kitchen. I can hear these boards creaking under the carpet but I pretend I don&#x2019;t hear it. I didn&#x2019;t dare ask what kind of job she might be applying for that required her to study for the test, but I&#x2019;ll just cross my fingers I won&#x2019;t have to add it to the long list of things she didn&#x2019;t end up doing.</p><p>Oh Lord. Did I just hear him move? Please don&#x2019;t let this be a Commercial Break Nap. He only watched four episodes of <i>Dora the Explorer</i> and he&#x2019;s got six more to go. Plus, I am not in the mood for entertaining him while I stand in this hot-ass kitchen in front of this electric stove in the middle of the afternoon with no air conditioner. It&#x2019;s broken. Just like he is. And I&#x2019;m right behind him. I can live without fried chicken. I&#x2019;m just doing this to make Lee David happy. He doesn&#x2019;t ask for much these days but he did manage to say, &#x201c;I want some soul food,&#x201d; and then flapped his bony little arms and made a clucking noise, which is why I&#x2019;m in here suffering. It&#x2019;s amazing what you&#x2019;ll do for your husband, even if you never loved him but he convinced you he loved you so you went on and married him and had his babies. Hell, I could be ironing my uniforms or writing Dexter a long-overdue letter, or reading a good paperback instead of struggling to fix enough food to last two or three days, since I can&#x2019;t be Julia Child every day.</p><p>Even though I propped that fan on top of four old encyclopedias and a phone book, it&#x2019;s still not cutting it, so I go to Plan B. I open the door and slide a chair in front of it, then set everything on top of it, turn that oscillator on, but all it&#x2019;s doing is pushing warm air on my behind, which is big enough to generate its own heat. I stick my head inside the freezer for a minute; inhale the cold, hoping it&#x2019;ll spread inside my body, which of course doesn&#x2019;t work.</p><p>I think I hear him stirring in there again so I lean my left ear toward the bedroom, but just to be on the safe side, I say, &#x201c;Anything I can get you, Mister?&#x201d; (Which is what I call him when I&#x2019;m talking directly to him.) While I wait for the response I hope not to get, I tighten the strings on this apron, cup my chin in my palms, and press my elbows on the damp counter. I look out the window at the orange trees at the side of the driveway. Not a single leaf on any of them is moving. This feels too much like earthquake weather. I don&#x2019;t appreciate this kind of stillness. We hadn&#x2019;t been here two days back in &#x2019;71 when that 6.6 sucker hit at the crack of dawn. We had come from New Orleans and I thought what a fucked-up welcome to California this was. But like fools, here we are almost thirty years later. You kind of get used to your house shaking, and you almost feel grateful if nothing breaks or the walls don&#x2019;t crack.</p><p>He clears his throat. So I carry on, making sure the oil is hot as I flick a few drops of water into a giant skillet and jump back. When a geyser shoots up from it, I know it&#x2019;s ready. I wish I could get rid of this big old electric stove and get a gas one. And a Kenmore. Stainless. It took years, but our Sears card has a zero balance and I&#x2019;m afraid to charge anything until I can be more certain about our future.</p><p>I pick up the Ziploc bag full of flour and sprinkle some seasoning salt, garlic powder, white pepper, and paprika inside it. Chicken breasts and thighs are piled up on a floral platter. These are the only pieces Lee David likes. After thirty-seven years of marriage, I&#x2019;ve forgotten how much I used to love wings. I dip a few pieces in a bowl of whisked eggs, drop them inside the bag, shake them back and forth, and then place them in the skillet. I wash my hands in warm water, stand in front of the sink even though I should sit down, and start snapping string beans.</p><p>&#x201c;Mrs. Butler? You got a big brown one from Dexter today. Want me to set it inside the screen door for you or leave it out here on the top step?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Inside is fine. Thanks, Mr. Jones. And you have a nice day.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Is that fried chicken I smell?&#x201d;</p><p>I just chuckle. Mr. Jones has been our mailman since we moved into this house, and it doesn&#x2019;t seem like he&#x2019;s ever going to retire. He&#x2019;s been a widower going on five years now. I don&#x2019;t know how he manages to do so much walking, especially in those thick black special shoes he has to wear. &#x201c;Stop back by when you get to Tammy&#x2019;s and I&#x2019;ll wrap you up a couple of pieces.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;You are so very kind,&#x201d; he says.</p><p>I walk through the dining room and living room and down one step onto the sunporch and pick up the mail. I recognize the bills by the color of the envelopes and set them on the buffet. I put Dexter&#x2019;s big envelope inside the magazine pouch on the left side of my La-Z-Boy with a ton of his letters I have not read. I get one every week, sometimes two. I can&#x2019;t read them like I used to.</p><p>I&#x2019;ll be the first to admit that I probably could&#x2019;ve been a better mother, and I&#x2019;ve got three grown children to prove it. It goes without saying that I do love them. I&#x2019;m just disappointed in how they turned out. Trinetta is the baby, and at twenty-seven she seems to have a hard time saying no to drugs and low-life men, which has made her allergic to working more than a few months at a time. Sometimes, it&#x2019;s hard for me to believe she&#x2019;s the same daughter who lived on the honor roll all during junior high school. But then between ninth grade and junior college she fell in love too many times to count and lost her mind. She also loved beautiful teeth and was on her way to becoming a dental technician when she got pregnant. Over the years, Trinetta tiptoed back and forth, and the last I heard, she&#x2019;s only twelve units shy of being employable. I used to remind her of this small fact but she would just get defensive. She has given birth to three children. The last one was Noxema. Her daddy went to court and got custody after she drank some shampoo and had to be rushed to emergency. I wish he would&#x2019;ve claimed those other two. Who they belong to is a mystery that may never get solved. In all honesty, I&#x2019;m one step away from calling Child Protection Services on her if she doesn&#x2019;t clean up her act soon.</p><p>My oldest, Quentin, likes cracking necks and backs, getting married, and getting divorced. He&#x2019;s a chiropractor and lives up in Oregon, where hardly any black people live, which has made it very easy for him to forget he&#x2019;s black. He enjoys being the token and hates the ghetto. He even calls me &#x201c;Mother,&#x201d; which gets on my nerves because it sounds so official, and he says it using the same tone as telemarketers when they ask for Mrs. Butler. I&#x2019;ve told him about a thousand times I don&#x2019;t like being called Mother, but he just ignores me. He was the same way when he was little. He doesn&#x2019;t bend. Does everything his way, which is what has made him so difficult to like. Somehow, someway, he has made himself believe he&#x2019;s superior to most folks. I don&#x2019;t know how he got this way, and why he feels more like a stranger I just happened to give birth to. The only time I seem to hear from him is when he&#x2019;s getting married or divorced. He&#x2019;s on his fourth or fifth wife. I can&#x2019;t keep up. One thing they all have in common is that they&#x2019;re white. Not that I care. But why they all have to be blonde is what baffles me. On top of everything, Quentin has the nerve to act like he&#x2019;s religious. He does not go to any church that I know of but claims to read the Bible every single morning. He must be a slow reader.</p><p>Then there&#x2019;s Dexter. He&#x2019;s in the middle. Another smart one who fell in love with stupidity. He&#x2019;s doing nine to twelve years for carjacking a Filipino woman in a Costco parking lot in broad daylight using a deadly weapon (which to this day he claims was just a flashlight and not a gun). He and his high school buddy, Buddy, thought this would be a fun thing to do since the bus was taking too long and they were both high on that marijuana and Bud Lights. Dexter said they were just trying to get out to Valencia so Buddy could go see his girlfriend in the hospital who had just had his baby, and Buddy didn&#x2019;t want to miss visiting hours. Dexter swore up and down this was all Buddy&#x2019;s idea even though Dexter was also supposed to meet his girlfriend, Skittles, at Great America, that amusement park right down the street from the hospital. Unfortunately, that marijuana must&#x2019;ve caused a temporary memory loss, because Dexter forgot that even stolen cars run on gas, which is why the highway patrolman didn&#x2019;t believe him when Dexter told him the bright yellow Jetta with &#x201c;Divina&#x201d; on the custom plates was his.</p><p>If I had it to do over, I probably wouldn&#x2019;t have had any kids. It&#x2019;s too much responsibility trying to steer somebody else&#x2019;s life when you&#x2019;re still trying to navigate your own. Back then kids didn&#x2019;t come with instructions, so you had to wing it. And based on all these modern books full of recipes on how to be a deluxe parent and raise damn near flawless children, I guess I&#x2019;d have to give myself a C or a C&#x2013; because apparently I did a whole lot of things wrong.</p><p>For starters, I didn&#x2019;t always put my kids first. I mean I had needs, too. Back then, between them and Lee David, I felt just like a pie. Everybody wanted a piece of me and barely left me with a little crust. Plus, I had to work. I did not talk to them in what they now call an inside voice. I talked to them like they were hard of hearing. It was the only way I could get their attention and let them know I meant business. Plus, I didn&#x2019;t like being a repeater. Saying the same damn thing over and over and over again and still not getting the results I was after. They were hardheaded. I&#x2019;m proud to say I did not swear at them, but every once in a while they did hear me say <i>shit</i> and <i>damn</i> and <i>oh hell no</i>, and five or six or ten times the &#x201c;F&#x201d; word. Apparently this was supposed to ruin them but I don&#x2019;t think that was what did it. I also said no a lot because many of the things they asked for were unreasonable. Or ridiculous. Time-outs hadn&#x2019;t been invented yet, which is why if they disobeyed me, I sometimes popped their little behinds. I didn&#x2019;t beat them, mind you, and never used any hand-held items. Again, my kids were hardheaded, so I doubt if sitting on a little stool in a corner would&#x2019;ve worked on them anyway.</p><p>Lee David might as well have been one of the kids, because he was just as needy and actually competed against them for my attention. I think he won. But my clock was slow: it took about twenty years to admit to myself how bored I was being his wife. He was pleasant enough and a reliable father and all but sometimes he felt more like a good friend who wouldn&#x2019;t go home. I guess it would be fair to say that I was just too lazy to divorce him. I also discovered that you can get used to a man, much like you do a household pet.</p><p>My mama raised four of us and she made it look easy. (I shouldn&#x2019;t count Monroe, who was almost thirteen when she took him in after her sister died, and he was trouble from the start.) But I&#x2019;m here to testify: Raising kids is not easy. It&#x2019;s work. Hard work. And work you don&#x2019;t get paid for. The worst part is when the little suckers grow up and don&#x2019;t appreciate the time and energy you put into them. Mine seem to have major lapses in memory. What they remember most is how much I got on their nerves. What I didn&#x2019;t give them. Not what I did. And they blame me for the things they didn&#x2019;t bother listening to. As if I never taught them anything. Or, that it was useless.</p><p>As a mother, you can&#x2019;t help but wonder where you went wrong and how much of your kids&#x2019; confusion is your fault. I probably should&#x2019;ve read more fairy tales and more often instead of just on my days o...</p></p><h2>Statistical Mechanics: A Set of Lectures</h2><p>Physics, rather than mathematics, is the focus in this classic graduate lecture note volume on statistical mechanics and the physics of condensed matter.

Each recipe features an anecdote by a band that performed at the Hope Collective, a popular punk venue in Dublin the author helped maintain for over a decade. (The Hope Collective became a blue print and inspiration for punk and DIY spaces across Ireland and the UK.) The book features contributions from over 120 people who donated their vegan recipes and thoughts on the importance of the punk rock community and culture, including stories from seminal punk banks such as Fugazi, Bikini Kill, and Chumbawamba.<br><br>In addition to great recipes, Please Feed Me uniquely illustrates the connections between community, art, activism and health. The thunderous subtext of the book is the vital underground community and network created and maintained by a collective of organizers and hundreds of musicians at a time when most punk bands were signing to major labels for the highest dollar amount. The book documents pieces of the stories of many popular US and international punk bands that continue to have a major influence on youth subcultures today.<br></p><p>Two vibrant countercultures collide to fizzling effect in this memoir/cookbook. McGuirk was one of the founders of the Hope Collective, a long-running Dublin community that promoted punk bands in the 1980s and '90s. The evolution of the Hope Collective and McGuirk's decision to go vegan seem born from the same activist impulse, and the author tries, through his recollections here, to focus a lens on a time in his life that was both revolutionary and spiritually nourishing. Yet for all the book's name-dropping (Fugazi, Bikini Kill and Chumbawamba were among the bands involved) the punk scene just doesn't come alive on the pages of this remembrance: there are few interesting anecdotes and a decided lack of a gritty, revolutionary spirit. It's a stretch to call this a cookbook, since the recipes take up less space than the photos and blow-by-blows of various shows. The dishes McGuirk shares, however, are simple, international comfort foods like Mixed Veg Noodles, Root Vegetable Soup with Greens, Vegan Tapenade, and Maple Sweet Potato Pudding. They aren't bad, considering that they were written by rockers instead of chefs, but foodies won't find anything truly inspired. In the end, only die-hard vegan punk-fans will be entertained&#x2014;and that may be all the author intended. <i>(Mar.)</i> <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

Their father was the Duke of York, the second son of King George V, and their Uncle David was the future King of England.<br><br>We all know how the fairy tale ended: When King George died, &#x201c;Uncle David&#x201d; became King Edward VIII---who abdicated less than a year later to marry the scandalous Wallis Simpson. Suddenly the little princesses&#x2019; father was King. The family moved to Buckingham Palace, and ten-year-old Princess Elizabeth became the heir to the crown she would ultimately wear for over fifty years.<br><br><i>The Little Princesses</i> shows us how it all began. In the early thirties, the Duke and Duchess of York were looking for someone to educate their daughters, Elizabeth and Margaret, then five- and two-years-old. They already had a nanny---a family retainer who had looked after their mother when she was a child---but it was time to add someone younger and livelier to the household.<br><br>Enter Marion Crawford, a twenty-four-year-old from Scotland who was promptly dubbed &#x201c;Crawfie&#x201d; by the young Elizabeth and who would stay with the family for sixteen years. Beginning at the quiet family home in Piccadilly and ending with the birth of Prince Charles at Buckingham Palace in 1948, Crawfie tells how she brought the princesses up to be &#x201c;Royal,&#x201d; while attempting to show them a bit of the ordinary world of underground trains, Girl Guides, and swimming lessons.<br><br><i>The Little Princesses</i> was first published in 1950 to a furor we cannot imagine today. It has been called the original &#x201c;nanny diaries&#x201d; because it was the first account of life with the Royals ever published. Although hers was a touching account of the childhood of the Queen and Princess Margaret, Crawfie was demonized by the press. The Queen Mother, who had been a great friend and who had, Crawfie maintained, given her permission to write the account, never spoke to her again.<br><br>Reading<i> The Little Princesse</i>s now, with a poignant new introduction by BBC royal correspondent Jennie Bond, offers fascinating insights into the changing lives and times of Britains royal family.<br></p><p>Marion Crawford, or &#x201c;Crawfie,&#x201d; as she was known to young Princess Elizabeth and Princess Margaret, was born in the Scottish countryside and studied teaching at the Moray House Training College in Edinburgh. In the early 1930s, she became governess to the daughters of the Duke and Duchess of York, little suspecting that she would devote the next sixteen years to nurturing her future Queen. Her account of life as a royal governess originally appeared in American magazines, but soon became a front-page sensation on both sides of the Atlantic. The first edition of <i>The Little Princesses</i> was published in 1950, and although it created a scandal, it was nonetheless a valuable social history and the first inside account of life at Buckingham Palace. Crawford died in 1988, having never been forgiven by the royal family for writing her book. <br><br>Jennie Bond has been following the Royal Family as the BBC&#x2019;s Royal correspondent for thirteen years. In that time, she has covered many momentous events---among them, three marriage breakdowns, Camillagate, the Queen&#x2019;s annus horribilis, and the death of Diana, Princess of Wales. Bond has written two other books:<i> Elizabeth: Fifty Glorious Years and Reporting Royalty: Behind the Scenes with the BBC&#x2019;s Royal Correspondent</i>. <br>In today's world of celebrity scandals and royal rumor, it's hard to believe that when this memoir was originally published in 1953 it caused such a stir. For 17 years, Crawford-"Crawfie"-was nanny to then-Princess Elizabeth and Princess Margaret, and taken on its own, her account is innocuous in the extreme. But Crawford was shunned by the royal family after the book's publication, as BBC Royal correspondent Bond explains in the foreword: "She was cast adrift as if she had committed treason and neither the Queen nor the two Princesses ever spoke to her again." To the contemporary jaded eye, it's far more interesting to read the book in this context rather than for its own merits. What might seem mundane becomes poignant in light of Crawford's eventual fate, such as when she fusses over her charges, describing 13-year-old Elizabeth ("Lilibet") as "an enchanting child with the loveliest hair and skin and a long, slim figure." Crawford's story is particularly sad given her degree of personal sacrifice-she delayed her marriage for years so as not to, as she saw it, abandon the king and queen. But it is possible to find repressed traces of bitterness on Crawford's part if one is so inclined, such as when she tells the queen that she would finally like to marry, and relates the queen's response: "'You must see, Crawfie, that it would not be at all convenient just now.'" There certainly aren't a lot of juicy tidbits, at least not by modern standards, but the book is interesting as an historical document, if for nothing else than to remind us how innocent scandal used to be.

Bond, and Jacqueline S. Weinstock, hoping to carry Belenky's theoretical work in the bestselling <i>Women's Ways of Knowing</i> into the realm of everyday life, created the Listening Partners project, designed to help young women isolated in rural poverty give voice to their personal and communal needs and come together to create social change<i>. A Tradition That Has No Name</i> explores this project and the work of other women who have created organizations to give voice to and strengthen traditions of community organizing and leadership, particularly as they have developed in communities of women marginalized by race and class. Ranging across cultures and classes from struggling inner-city neighborhoods to affluent middle-class suburbs, from African American communities in the South to poor rural communities in Vermont the book teaches us how to appreciate the ways women create networks of listening and community-building, and how to bring these little-recognized traditions of women's activism to the forefront of public life. It is these public homeplaces&#x201d; women create together, the authors argue, that hold the key for empowering communities and creating social change.</p><p><b>Mary Field Belenky</b> is a consultant who works with community and educational organizations and an associate research professor at the University of Vermont. She lives in Marshfield, Vermont, and New York City.<br><br><b>Lynne A. Bond</b> is professor of psychology at the University of Vermont and a consultant in community development in the United States and abroad. She lives in Charlotte, Vermont.<br><br><b>Jacqueline S. Weinstock</b> is assistant professor in the Human Development and Family Studies Program within the College of Education and Social Services at the University of Vermont. She lives in Burlington, Vermont.An academic report, including research projects that uphold ``women's ways of knowing'' and programs that allow women to grow by ``gaining a voice,'' that is both uplifting and redundant. Coauthor Belenky (Women's Ways of Knowing, not reviewed) is one of the researchers who probed the idea that women receive and process knowledge in a way different from men. With her University of Vermont colleagues (Bond, Psychology; Weinstock, Education/Social Services) she further explores how women develop as leaders, ``raising up'' rather than ``ruling over'' the next generation (as opposed to men's thinking in such matters, which is more authoritarian). The emphasis here is on a funded project carried out in rural Vermont called ``Listening Partners.'' The goal was to reach isolated women, bring them together, and help them develop independent modes of thought through mutual encouragement. As the women gathered in small groups organized by the authors, it was hoped (and affirmed) that they would move up through stages of thought (from ``Silenced'' to ``Constructivist''), and that the women would then be able to teach their children a more creative mode of thinking about the world. The book moves on to discuss observations of natural female leaders in small and large communities--``homeplaces''- -who achieve communal goals by nurturing individual strengths in their neighbors and emphasizing consensus and cooperation. Among the grassroots organizations examined are the National Congress of Neighborhood Women and two Mothers' Center groups, one in Germany and one in the US. Most of the women who practice what the authors call ``developmental leadership'' have their roots in African-American communities. Although the research and observations validate and celebrate female styles of leadership that flourish around kitchen tables and in church basements, the accounts of success stories are often muddled and repetitious, with far too much attention paid to how research projects were designed. -- <i>Copyright �1997, Kirkus Associates, LP.

His recent work on the plant kingdom and the seven levels is fast gaining in popularity and promises to revolutionize Homoeopathy. More and more Homoeopaths are incorporating his ideas into practice, with the most promising results.His lucid style and simplicity makes him very popular as a teacher amongst Homoeopaths worldwide. His seminars and teaching courses have been widely attended in India and abroad. He has lectured in Australia, Austria, Belgium, Canada, England, France, Germany, Holland, Israel, Italy, New Zealand, Norway, Russia, Slovakia, Spain, South Africa ,Switzerland and U.S.A. Along with his colleagues he founded The Homoeopathic Research and Charities, which is an Institution involved in various teaching courses. He has been awarded a Fellowship of the Society of Homeopaths ( U.K.).He has authored The Spirit of Homoeopathy, The Substance of Homoeopathy, The Soul of Remedies, Provings, The System in Homoeopathy, An Insight into Plants, and recently The Sensation in Homoeopathy which is a milestone by itself, and above all, he has also created a Homoeopathic case taking and analysis software Vital Quest . Dr. Rajan Sankaran lives and practices in Juhu area of Mumbai, India. He has two sons, Soham and Sahaj. Through his writings and lectures, Dr. Sankaran has had a profound influence on many modern homeopaths&#39; methods of practice.He is particularly well-known for developing a highly structured view of the Materia Medica. He has also developed a case-analysis software program called Vital Quest. Dr. Rajan Sankaran has been practicing Homeopathy since 1981. He is internationally renowned as a clear and original thinker and is best known for his path breaking concepts in Homoeopathy. His original ideas and lucid style make him very popular as a teacher amongst homoeopaths worldwide. His seminars and teaching courses have been widely attended in India, Australia, Austria, Germany, U.S.A, England, Switzerland, France, Spain, Canada, Holland, Norway, New Zealand, Russia, Israel ,South Africa, Belgium, Spain, Italy, Korea and Japan. He has authored several books namely The Spirit of Homoeopathy, The Substance of Homoeopathy, The Soul of Remedies, Provings, The System of Homoeopathy, An Insight into Plants , The Sensation in Homeopathy, Sankaran s Schema and the software VitalQuest. Many of the books are considered modern texts in Homeopathy and have been translated in several languages.Most of the remedies presented have been previously published in The Spirit of Homeopathy and The Science of Homeopathy. Here Dr. Sankaran has revised and corrected the original writings. This book begins with a lucid introduction that clearly defines the background and use of the information contained. He writes: &#34;The material presented here has been observed and confirmed in my own practice; it is material I am sure of. I have not included remedies of which I have little experience or knowledge. I have attempted to convey the innermost feeling or the basic delusion of the remedy while connecting the situation, source, miasm and kingdom. The rubrics and physical symptoms cited are ones which I have observed repeatedly and often used to confirm the remedy prescribed. These ideas have helped me in my clinical practice and I wish to share them with the profession.&#34; Regarding his understanding of each remedy (essences of remedies), Rajan writes, &#34;Mere is a common misconception to the effect that I stress mental and emotional symptoms to the exclusion of physical symptoms. This, I repeat, is a misconception. If I often seem to speak exclusively of the mental/emotional state, it is because understanding this requires some degree of insight into the patient as well as into the remedy and it is more difficult than noting physical symptoms. Nonetheless, in practice I give a lot of importance to the physical symptoms, to the meaning of the pathology, and to the modalities which have to be matched with those of the remedy. Giving a remedy solely on a vague idea of the mental picture is a prescription for failure. Such an approach is risky and certainly not one that I follow or recommend. &#34;...I have tired to bring out the innermost feelings of the remedy and it is not easy to discover these in patients other than by artistic case-taking which delves deeply into such things as the patients delusions, dreams, hobbies, etc. What appears on the surface might be quite different from what is actually inside...&#34; My idea of understanding a remedy is to grasp the connection that ties together its myriad symptoms: the basic delusion, its source (kingdom), the miasm to which it belongs, its symptoms- all must be understood as aspects of a single whole if we are to even begin to truly understand a remedy. It is my attempt to tract out these connections that distinguishes this work from other Materia Medicas. I believe, for example, that the connecting link: in Sepia is the feeling that she is forced to do something against her intention. In the section on Sepia I try to show how this &#34;link&#34; connects every aspect of the remedy. This has been confirmed by me in practice time and again-I do not believe it is mere theory ... and yet the reader must remember that this is Rajan&#39;s experience and not necessarily the final word. &#34;This book is meant for those who have read The Spirit of Homeopathy and The Substance of Homeopathy because it those earlier works that most fully express my understanding of the Organon and Materia Medica. Without an understanding of my ideas on such things as case-taking, classification of remedies according to kingdom, miasms, etc., this book will not be of much benefit. This book may be used as an adjunct to the previous works but not as a substitute for them.&#34; Exactly one hundred remedies are included, both polychrests and &#34;small remedies.&#34; Much of this book is original material, reflecting the insight, experience and genius of Dr. Rajan Sankaran. Keeping these introductory words in mind, I strongly recommend this new book to all homeopaths. Dr. Sankaran is making an important contribution to the existing homeopathic materia medica. --Simillimum,Winter 1997 Volume X No. 4</p><h2>Buffy: Season Ten Volume 2 - I Wish (Buffy the Vampire Slayer: Season 10)</h2><p>Buffy and her crew get their fight on, as they try to take control of the new rules of magic!

Most investigators would call it a cut-and-dried case, but nothing is ever that simple.<br> Teamed with Bian Tran, the attractive Army Military Police officer investigating the case, Drummond is about to embark on a journey that takes him from the labyrinthine channels of American intelligence to the killing rooms of Iraq. None of it will be more difficult than navigating the shadowy minds and motivations of his enemies and so-called colleagues.<br> What Drummond uncovers will make him question everything he believes in. Because the more he digs, the more he learns about the key players-American and Middle Eastern-in a war that rages bloodier every day. A war where betrayal is a daily occurrence and makes him ask: Are my loyalties to my superiors or to the American soldiers battling for their lives?<br></p><p>BRIAN HAIG is the New York Times bestselling author of six novels featuring JAG attorney Sean Drummond.

For more information on the author you can visit his website at www.brianhaig.com.Despite the intention declared in an author's note to broaden Americans' understanding of the current war in Iraq, bestseller Haig (<i>Private Sector</i>) delivers a routine mystery thriller that awkwardly blends fact and fiction. Lt. Col. Sean Drummond, Haig's wisecracking series hero, finds himself partnered with an exotic female military police officer, Bian Tran, when Clifford Daniels, a high-ranking Defense Department official, is found dead in his Virginia apartment, an apparent suicide. The pair soon learn that Daniels was the U.S.'s main liaison with Mahmoud Charabi, an Iraqi exile who, like the real-life Ahmed Chalabi, was a leading advocate of military action to topple Saddam Hussein. The discovery that Charabi may have been in the employ of Iranian intelligence raises the stakes for the inquiry, which takes place just weeks before the 2004 presidential election. The action detours to the Iraqi war zone before the predictable windup. <i>(Jan.)</i> <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

At this locale, great numbers of native people and Europeans congregated each summer to trade. In addition, fur trade personnel acquired birchbark canoes, equipment, and provisions here for their far-flung journeys to other regions, and here they stored large amounts of westbound merchandise and eastbound furs and hides. From this central location at the Straits, native and European forces were dispatched on numerous occasions over the decades, to fight military campaigns far afield. Also, amy expeditions intent upon exploration or missionary efforts were launched from Mackinac.</p><p>Timothy Kent has located and translated large numbers of original French documents concerning these various activities, while he has also gathered most of the previously published ones as well. Through this extensive research, the author has woven a highly detailed, year-by-year chronicle of these many events, which focused upon the Mackinac area but occurred in the vast region which stretched from the home colony along the St. Lawrence Valley to the distant west and northwest. He has likewise compiled a similarly thorough account of the first two decades after British forces took control of North America in 1760. During this latter period, the fur trade of the French era actively continued, with gradually increasing British participation.</p><p>More than fifty original French documents are translated and published for the first time in this work. These include legal agreements, outfitters' ledgers, letters from traders, officers, and missionaries, inventories of trading stores and military forts, official government ordinances , and lists of materiel for native allies. Interweaving these documents with hundreds of previously published government and military reports, fur trade licenses, and travel accounts, Kent clearly presents the history of the period, and exposes many aspects of life during this era which are little known. These range from rampant prostitution to widespread trade in native slaves, from the huge amounts of illegal commerce to the realities of French-native relations.</p></p><p>A detailed chronicle of events in colonial-era Michilimackinac, drawing extensively on previously unpublished primary source material.Timothy J. Kent is an independent scholar and lecturer living in Ossineke, Michigan. He is author of several books, including Fort Pontchartrain at Detroit, Volumes I and II: A Guide to the Daily Lives of Fur Trade and Military Personnel, Settlers, and Missionaries at French Posts for which he received the prestigious Award of Merit for 2002 from the Historical Society of Michigan.</p><h2>The Psychology Of Selling: How To Sell More, Easier, and Faster Than you Ever Thought Possible</h2><p><p>Brian Tracy, one of the top professional speakers and sales trainers in the world today, found that his most important breakthrough in selling was the discovery that it is the "Psychology of Selling" that is more important than the techniques and methods of selling. </p> <p>Tracy's classic audio program, <em>The Psychology of Selling</em>, is the best-selling sales training program in history and is now available in expanded and updated book format for the first time. Salespeople will learn:</p><li>"the inner game of selling"</li><li>how to eliminate the fear of rejection</li><li>how to build unshakeable self-confidence</li> <p>Salespeople, says Tracy, must learn to control their thoughts, feelings, and actions to make themselves more effective.</p></p><p>Brian Tracy is Chairman and CEO of Brian Tracy International, a company specializing in the training and development of individuals and organizations. He has consulted for more than 1,000 companies and addressed more than 5,000,000 people in 5,000 talks and seminars throughout the US, Canada and 55 other countries worldwide. As a Keynote speaker and seminar leader, he addresses more than 250,000 people each year. He has written and produced more than 300 audio and video learning programs, including the worldwide, best-selling Psychology of Achievement, which has been translated into more than 20 languages.With his 300-odd video and audio courses (sales at one mil.), and 30 books, Tracy has built a strong motivational sales and marketing brand. This latest installment shapes pop psychological constructs to fit Tracy's existing paradigms: "Your subconscious does not think or decide. It merely obeys your mental commands." Tell that to Dr. Freud, one might retort, but the point here is not fidelity to psychology theory, but efficacy in getting readers to change the way they bring themselves to a sale. Visualization techniques, concrete sales advice and motivational pep talks make up chapters like "The Inner Game of Selling" and "The Power of Suggestion." The "Getting More Appointments" chapter recapitulates sound but Willy Lohman-esque advice like "Sidestep the Excuse" or "Don't Be Put Off"; the book as a whole feels familiar, but it's clearly organized. Even in Tracy's generic prose, the repackaged tried-and-trues will find their marks. <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

In the crispness of its writing and editing, the bite of its criticsand commentators, the range of its coverage, and the clarity ofitstypography, the "<i>Trib</i>" (as media people and many of itsreadersaffectionately called it) raised newspapering to an art form. Ithad aninfluence and importance out of all proportion to itscirculation.Abraham Lincoln valued its support so highly during theCivil War hewent to great lengths to retain the allegiance of itsco-founder HoraceGreeley. And President Eisenhower felt it was sosignificant a nationalinstitution and Republican organ that while in the White House he helped broker the sale of the paper to its last owner,multimillionaire JohnHay Whitney.<br><br>It begins in pre-Civil War New York City with two bitter enemieswho,between them, practically invented the newspaper as we know it: the Herald's James Gordon Bennett, a cynic who brought aggressive honesty to reporting for the first time, and the <i>Tribune</i>'s Greeley, whose passion for social justice and vision of anationaldestiny made him an American icon and the most widely readpolemicistsince Tom Paine. These two giant figures loomed above acolorful,intensely competitive age, and with a novelist's sense ofdetail andcharacter, Kluger gives us an engaging picture of them andtheir time.Here are Bennett breaking new ground in 1836 with hisextended coverageof the sensational murder of a well-known prostitutenear City Hall... the <i>Tribune</i> scooping the WarDepartment on theoutcome of the Battle of Antietam in 1862...Greeleygoing upstate totestify in a libel suit brought against him by JamesFenimore Cooper,then rushing back to the city in time to write ahilarious account ofthe trial for the next morning's edition...the birth of investigativejournalism as the <i>Tribune</i>'s editors cracked the coded messages proving that Tilden's backers tried to fix the presidential election of 1876.<br> <br>After the two papers and their twotraditions - political and reportorial -merged early in the twentiethcentury, the fate of the <i>Herald Tribune</i>became intertwined with that of the pride-driven Reid family and itsdynasticrule of the paper. In particular, it is the story of HelenReid, thesocial secretary who married the owner's son and became thepaper'sdominant force, and of her two sons, whose fratricidal struggleforcontrol helped bring about its downfall. To try to save it, oneofAmerica's richest men lent his name and fortune as a last wave ofstafftalent redefined the limits and redesigned the look of U.S.dailyjournalism.<br> The <i>Tribune</i>story ispopulated with a Dickensian cast of characters: Ishbel Ross,the daintylittle woman who was the best and hardest-working reporter of hertime...the acerbic city editor, Stanley Walker, and his successor, L. L. Engelking, who set a standard of city-room fervor and ferocity for ageneration of newsmen...Homer Bigart, the stuttering copyboy whobecameAmerica's finest and most daring combat correspondent...thebeautiful,bitchy, and intensely competitive Marguerite Higgins, who won a Pulitzer Prize by the time she was thirty...as well as modern figureslikehumorist Art Buchwald, crack drama critic Walter Kerr,straight-from-the gut reporter and columnist Jimmy Breslin, and crackscience writer Earl Ubell.<br> <br>Above all, <i>The Paper</i> is a rich and revealing work of social and literary history,andexploration of the "free" in free press, and an elegiac tribute tothefading world of print journalism that spawned and sustained whatwas,line for line, America's best newspaper.</p><p>"Probably the best book ever written about an American newspaper. But it is more than that - a brilliant piece of social history that recountsin vivid and telling detail the changing conception of 'news' inAmerica....

It is loaded to the gunnels with newspaper anecdotes,but at its core <i>The Paper</i> is a book about the relationship between the press and the powerful, the press and the wealthy."<br><br>-- The Washington PostSince its mid-Sixties death, the Herald Tribune has grown in legend as the newspaperman's newspaper. This lovingly detailed valentine to its memory is written by a former reporter for the paper, who says that every time a newspaper dies, "the country moves a little closer to authoritarianism . . . and when a great one goes, . . .history is denied a devoted witness." A typical journalism history of a single paper, however good, doesn't quite make that point. Kluger's Simple Justice (1976) , which chronicled the judicial drive to end segregated public schools, grew in stature as the detail accrued; here the detail simply buries the import of the story. Still, while this may not be the grand social commentary Kluger would have liked, it is a splendidly told story of a newspaper.

His work has been described as &#x201c;Tintin Meets the Freak Brothers in the Cape of Good Dope.&#x201d; His books include Scrublands, The Red Monkey Double Happiness Book, and Dungeon Quest.Anyone who ever got into fantasy role-playing games during their early adolescence no doubt remembers how those early forays into heroic adventuring could be fraught with profane characters, ludicrous moments during breaks from the quest at hand, and the strange, often puerile creations of a hormonally charged dungeon master. All of those elements fuel the entertaining world that Daly drops readers into with this continuation of a band of adventurers who quest after the scattered components of the Atlantean Resonator Guitar. There are encounters with monsters, violent battles, magical items to be gathered, eerie dungeons, and so on, but we are also treated to a hilarious bit where the characters get zooted on weed and cocaine while spouting drug-appropriate dialogue. With a visual style that's a gene-splicing of Charles Burns's Lynchian creepiness with an underground sensibility, this quirky work is every bit as entertaining as it sounds, spouting anarchic humor in every direction.

She was an intrepid explorer of the Brazilian rainforest and an outstanding botanical artist, acclaimed by botanists and art critics worldwide. At the age of 47 Mee started exploring the Amazon, travelling throughout the wildest parts of Amazonia for the next thirty years. Mee learned to live with the forest and its plants, animals and people and learnt much from the Native people about the trees and plants she so meticulously painted. Mee initially sketched the plants in the forest and then worked on the large illustrations of the entire plant in her studio in Rio de Janeiro. Nine of these plants recorded by Mee, previously unknown to science, are now named after her. Flowers of the Amazon Forests: The Botanical Art of Margaret Mee illustrates more than sixty of Mee&#39;s major works with additional sketches painted while in the forest. The text is taken directly from the diaries she kept whilst travelling, giving</p><p>Margaret Mee (1909-1988) worked as a draughtsman for De Havilland during the Second World War and afterwards retrained at St. Martin&#39;s School of Art and Camberwell School of Art where she studied under Victor Pasmore. Her first of many expeditions to the waterways of Amazonia was in 1956 when she was forty-seven; her last was in 1988, aged seventy-nine. She was tragically killed in a road accident in England. Recognition of her work came in the form of financial support from the Brazilian government, the National Geographic Society and a Guggenheim Fellowship. In 1976 she was awarded an M.B.E., and in 1979 the Order of Cruzeiro do Sul (Brazil) for her services to botanical research.&#34;On seeing her paintings for the first time.

The word kanuna is an ancient term and is in use today. It is pronounced &#34;kah-hoo-nah&#34; and meant &#34;keeper of the secret.&#34; The word for their secret lore was never found. The role of secrecy had been so strong and so well kept that it may never have been given a name... The name we used, for this reason, was Huna (pronounced &#34;hoo-nah&#34;), which means &#34;secret.&#34; .... [E]nough basic information will be incorporated in this book to give a working picture of the system of beliefs and practices upon which experimental work has been based.... Interspersed with the instructions will be found explanations of the sources of conclusions, of symbols, words, and word-roots familiar to Huna, but which we also found in other religions, mainly Christianity. These will tend to show that the meanings ascribed to Huna are well founded... That the same truth pervades all psycho-religious systems is apparent. The basic elements of Huna are part of the ancient wisdom found is some proportions in all religions. Huna is compatible with other systems. It interferes with none of them, but makes possible a greater understanding of the old truths. --- excerpts from book&#39;s Introduction</p><p></p><h2>The Seven Rays Made Visual: An Illustrated Introduction to the Teaching on the Seven Rays</h2><p>The Seven Rays Made Visual: An Illustrated Introduction to the Teaching on the Seven Rays of Djwhal Khul and Alice A.

Rollins' rare blend of action, suspense, and knowledge was also mentioned by the Huffington Post, which stated that "After Crichton passed away in 2008 he clearly passed the baton to James Rollins, who like Crichton, is a renaissance man."<br><br>NPR calls his work "adventurous and enormously engrossing..." and the New York Journal of Books had this to say: "If you're a fan of smart, entertaining adventure fiction, this is your summer beach read writ large....All the science, all the history, and all the locations are masterfully intertwined. The characters are multi-dimensional.

Other members of the greatest generation describe their war &#x2014; in such historic episodes as Guadalcanal, the D-Day invasion, the Battle of the Bulge, and Midway &#x2014; as well as their life on the home front. In this beautiful American family album of stories, reflections, memorabilia, and photographs, history comes alive and is preserved, in people&#x2019;s own words and through photographs and time lines that commemorate important dates and events. Starting with the Depression and Pearl Harbor, on through the war in Europe and the Pacific, this unusual book preserves a people&#x2019;s rich historical heritage and the legacy of the heroism of a nation.</p><p>Tom Brokaw has turned his popular book <i>The Greatest Generation</i> into a trilogy. After that first success came <i>The Greatest Generation Speaks</i>. Now there's <i>An Album of Memories</i>, a collection of letters and photos sent to Brokaw by readers who grew up during the Depression and came of age during World War II. <p> <i>An Album of Memories</i> simply overflows with nostalgia. "We were privileged to grow up in a time when honor, truth, loyalty, duty, and patriotism were real and meant something," writes Robert Cromer. Another correspondent, Douglas G. Fish, describes his own wartime experience--and that of many others--with an elegant simplicity: "I went in the service as a boy and came out a man." There are poignant letters from the dead. One reader submitted this one, sent home in 1942: "Dear Mom, I got your package and Dot's letter today. Boy, the cookies were swell, all the boys send their thanks. Not a one of them was crushed either." Almost exactly a year later, the writer was killed on a bombing run. Another man shares "the last letter my father wrote, three days before he died." It reads: "Tomorrow is D-Day at Iwo Jima--right on Japan's front doorstep--we will go in and lay nets sometime during the assault.... I have faith in God to help us through to victory but am prepared to die for America and face our Lord if He so wills it." The son who sent this letter to Brokaw wasn't even born until after his father had been killed: "I read [this letter] every year on Memorial Day, cry a lot, and think of what a hero he was," he writes. </p><p> It's hard not to agree with that assessment, and it applies to so many of those who fought bravely in Europe or the Pacific, as well as those who maintained the home front. All of them have their say in this attractive volume. <i>--John J.

Reissue. 150,000 first printing.</p><p>Jack Clark is an award winning journalist who has been writing for the Chicago Reader since 1975. He is the winner of the Chicago Newspaper Guild's Page One Award for feature writing.<br> His first novel, "Westerfield's Chain," featuring Chicago Private detective Nick Acropolis, was a finalist for the Shamus Award for best first private eye novel. It's been joined by two other Acropolis novels: "Highway Side" and "Dancing on Graves."<br> He is also author of the oral history "On the Home Front," with his mother Mary Jo Clark. It was published by Plume in 2002.<br> Jack was a long-haul furniture mover for Allied Van Lines for many years. He's also been driving a taxi on and off for the last 35 years. He has lived in Chicago his entire life.No matter what you might expect from a novel by a cabdriver -- "Nobody's Angel" is a gem. For what it is, it's just about perfect. I won't urge would-be novelists to forsake their writing classes and become hackers, but they would do well to read Clark's story, which doesn't contain a wasted word or a false note...Its real beauty lies in [cabbie] Eddie [Miles] bittersweet existence and the special romance and danger of the cabdriver's life -- lives we often glimpse but rarely give a second thought.--<i>Washington Post</i><br><br><i>Nobody's Angel</i>&nbsp;has the wry humor and engaging characters typical of the best of the hard-boiled genre, but Clark's portrait of Chicago in the 1990s, with its vanishing factories and jobs, its lethal public housing projects, its teenage hookers climbing into vans on North Avenue, is what gives it legs. Sure there are a couple murderers on the loose, but the larger violence is coming from systemic forces wreaking havoc in a place that, maybe, used to be better.--<i>Chicago Reader</i><br><br>Eddie Miles is a regular guy with a sad past and a big heart and a hard boiled city attitude. He's like you and me, the sort of protagonist I most like reading about in so-called crime fiction.<br>Jack Clark first self-published "Nobody's Angel" and sold it out of his cab. Eventually the excellent crime fiction publishers, Hard Case Crime, republished the book under their imprint--an inspiring story for everyday Joes and Josephines who write in their spare time. Do yourself a favor and flag it down.--<i>Uncorrected Proof</i><br><br>"The anecdotal structure pulls you along at just the right pace and the economics of his story telling are commendable. There's a world of intriguing and memorable detail expertly packed into two-hundred pages and just the right amount of heartache. The book's close features one of the best final lines of any book I've ever read. Please don't pick it up and read that last page first, it's so worth getting there naturally."<i>&nbsp;</i><i>--Barnes &amp; Noble Ransom Notes</i></p><h2>Three by Truman Capote: Other Voices, Other Rooms; Breakfast at Tiffany&#39;s; Music for Chameleons</h2><p>Gathers two novels, interviews, and nonfiction accounts of murder written by the controversial, New Orleans-born author</p><p></p><h2>The Art of Cars</h2><p>In the tradition of the smash hits <i>Toy Story</i>, <i>A Bug's Life</i>, <i>Toy Story 2</i>, <i>Monsters, Inc.</i>, <i>Finding Nemo</i>, and <i>The Incredibles</i> comes the newest film from Pixar Animation Studios, <i>Cars</i>, the story of a race car who learns that it's not all about the fast lane.

White lightning. White whiskey. Mountain dew. Moonshine goes by many names. So what is it, really? Technically speaking, "moonshine" refers to untaxed liquor made in an unlicensed still. In the United States, it&#x2019;s typically corn that&#x2019;s used to make the clear, unaged beverage, and it&#x2019;s the mountain people of the American South who are most closely associated with the image of making and selling backwoods booze at night&#x2014;by the light of the moon&#x2014;to avoid detection by law enforcement.</p> <p>In this book, writer Jaime Joyce explores America&#x2019;s centuries-old relationship with moonshine. From the country&#x2019;s early adoption of Scottish and Irish home-distilling techniques and traditions to the Whiskey Rebellion of the late 1700s to a comparison of the moonshine industry pre- and post-Prohibition and a look at modern-day craft distilling, Joyce examines the historical context that gave rise to moonshining in America and explores its continued appeal. Even more fascinating than the popularity of the liquor itself is moonshine&#x2019;s widespread effect on U.S. pop culture: moonshine runners were NASCAR&#x2019;s first marquee drivers; white whiskey was the unspoken star of countless Hollywood film and television productions; and numerous songs inspired by making shine have come from such musicians as Dolly Parton, Steve Earle, Metallica, Ween, and others. While we can&#x2019;t condone making your own illegal liquor, reading Moonshine will give you a new perspective on the profound implications that underground moonshine making has had on life in America.</p></p><p>Jaime Joyce&#39;s work has appeared in Saveur, Edible Manhattan, Edible Brooklyn, and the online edition of The Atlantic as well as on the Big Roundtable, a website for long-form narrative nonfiction. She earned master&#39;s degrees at Bank Street College of Education and Columbia University&#39;s Graduate School of Journalism, where she was awarded the Lynton Book Writing Fellowship. She is an editor at Time Inc.Website: http://jaimejoyce.comTwitter: @jaime_joyce<p>"In an age of craft distilling, moonshine has been reborn as an artisanal spirit. So it is only fitting that white lightning has also gotten as eloquent and learned a chronicler as Jaime Joyce. Her book, so informative and so pleasurable, deserves a toast of its own." - <b>Samuel G. Freedman, journalist and author</b></p><br><br><p>"Call it unaged corn whiskey, white lightning, or just likker, home-brew moonshine has been a part of American cultural consciousness since colonial times. In her debut book, Joyce provides a highly readable survey of the economic, legal, and culinary aspects of the drink from pre-Revolutionary days through Prohibition and on to the current craft brewing renaissance. The pacing is lively, and numerous illustrations, bits of trivia, and the occasional drink recipe will keep audiences engaged through to the end. The choice to use unmarked endnotes is a wise one for a nonacademic work of this size, keeping the text uncluttered while allowing interested readers to explore Joyce's sources in greater depth.<b>Verdict</b> A shot of pop history that goes down easy and packs a punch. Recommended for home-brewing fans and cultural history buffs looking for a broad overview of the topic." �?? <i><b>Library Journal</b></i></p><br><br><p>"The history of moonshine is a tumultuous one, and it's too often a misunderstood and underappreciated story.

Joyce's in-depth view of the story creates an engaging invitation for the eager spirit enthusiast." - <b>Dan Amatuzzi, author of</b><i><b> A First Course in Wine </b></i><b>and Eataly wine director</b></p><br><br><p>"In this, her first book, journalist Jaime Joyce writes with a fizzy vigor, clearly savoring the stories of old-time moonshiners and their world." - <i><b>The Boston Globe</b></i></p><br><br><p>"... a compulsively readable account of America's most infamous likker." - <i><b>Biographile.com</b></i></p><br><br><p>"The history of stock car racing is intertwined with the history of bootlegging and the men who raced their illegal liquid cargo in souped-up Fords through the back roads of Appalachia.

Thirty years later, Revel is back with the same purpose. His latest book, a bestseller in France, comes at a crucial time. It seeks to explain the root cause of the world's and particularly Europe's obsession with hating America. He does not pretend that America is perfect. But he argues that the daily denunciations exceed the bounds of reasonable criticism. Furthermore, Revel says, European critics are quick to point fingers when they should be looking in the mirror. Rather than mock America's 2000 presidential election, he notes, Europeans should have been examining their own abysmally run European Union. He attributes such inconsistencies to Europeans' desperate desire to "project our faults onto America so as to absolve ourselves." Revel further finds fault with the antiglobalization movement. Though the movement claims to oppose inequality and poverty in underdeveloped countries, its true anathema is liberal capitalism, whose chief representative is the United States. The barrage of attacks will make it impossible for the United States to confer with European officials or take any criticism seriously. It is in Europe's interest, Revel says, to put aside its envy and consider a more constructive relationship with the United States. As a French citizen, the author laments the sorry state of his home country; he believes that careful consideration of American principles will strengthen Europe. Revel writes with a style at once informative and incisive. He possesses a sarcastic wit that is undoubtedly as irritating to his critics as it is endearing to his supporters. <br>Copyright 2003 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Tough Guy</h2><p><p>Foreword by Steve Yzerman</p><p>With a Special Foreword by Dani Probert</p><p>During a notorious career with the Detroit Red Wings and the Chicago Blackhawks, Bob Probert racked up points, penalty minutes and bar bills, establishing himself as one of the most feared enforcers in the history of the NHL. On the ice, he was a fan favourite. He backed up his teammates one hundred percent, taking on the toughest guys of his era. Off the ice, Probert played hard too. Over his pro career he went through ten stays in rehab, two NHL suspensions, a jail sentence for carrying cocaine across the border and a near fatal motorcycle crash. When he died unexpectedly of a heart attack on July 5, 2010, at the age of forty-five, he was hard at work on his memoir with Kirstie McLellan Day, co-author with Theo Fleury of the blockbuster <em>Playing with Fire</em>. Probert wanted to tell his story in his own words to set the record straight.</p><p><em>Tough Guy</em> is a gripping journey, full of jaw-dropping stories about Bob&#x2019;s on-ice battles and his reckless off-ice encounters with drugs, alcohol, customs officials, police, courts and the NHL. Probert&#x2019;s opponents often feared him, but they always respected the man beneath the bloodied jersey. With his unique sense of humour and inside stories, Probert gives us a first-hand account of his adrenalin-fuelled life as the toughest fighter in the NHL.</p></p><p><p>Bob Probert, born and raised in Windsor, Ontario, was a winger with the Detroit Red Wings and the Chicago Blackhawks between 1985 and 2002. A loving husband to Dani and a dedicated father to their four children, Probert supported many local charities and twice visited the troops in Afghanistan. He died suddenly on July 5, 2010, while boating with his family near Windsor.

Albright</h2><p>Whenever one watches the Us Secretary of State Madeleine Albright on TV, one cannot but notice her extravagant jewellery. Few people realise, however, that the restrained beauty of this jewellery is often invested with an unmistakable message: After the Iraqi press portrayed her as a she met with Iraqi officials. During the difficult Middle East peace talks, a dove of peace adorned her shoulder and watched over the proceedings. Mrs Albright employs her diplomacy, a weapon barred to men. 61 artists from 16 countries responded to the challenge suggested by Helen Drutt from Philadelphia, to create highly individual brooches themed with Albright&#39;s strategic use of adornment. The results are a glittering show of jewellery covering a wide spectrum of shapes, materials and meaning. Each artist interpreted the challenge in a different way.

Northern Light: Realism and Symbolism in Scandinavian Painting, 1880-1910 gives us such an opportunity. The somewhat special approach that was taken in organizing the exhibition should be made clear. Any survey of thirty active years of painting in five different countries will necessarily be limited. But while Northern Light, with ninety-four paintings representing the work of thirty-six artists, is selective in the obvious sense, our focus is more sharply defined. It was evident from the earliest consultation with our colleagues that an exhibition composed of selections made by curators in each of the five countries, broadly surveying the five national schools with a goal of arithmetic evenhandedness, while inviting for its dictionary-like qualities, would in the end do a great disservice to the art. Thus, while Kirk Varnedoe and his co-curator, Sarah Faunce, benefited from the guidance and generous cooperation of our colleagues in Scandinavia, the selection was approached without the obligation to be all-inclusive....The exhibition often contradicts national notions regarding paintings, artists, and relative importance. Certain artists of recognized merit...do not appear. In some cases, as in the regrettable absence of Jens Ferdinand Willumsen of Denmark, insurmountable conservation problems made it impossible for an artist&#39;s key pieces to travel. In general, however, the final selection reflects Professor Varnedoe&#39;s approach - to isolate works of particular styles and themes so that they might, as a group, offer a broad sampling of the artists of the period even as they illuminate the patterns of development he sees as central to Northern painting of the period....&#34;</p><p></p><h2>Deadline: The Third Secret of Fatima</h2><p>The most knowledgeable Fatima expert of our time analizes the Third Secret of Fatima.

At a time when Republicans and Democrats alike embrace increasingly militaristic border enforcement policies under the guise of security, and local governments around the country are taking matters into their own hands,&nbsp;<em>Dying to Live</em>&nbsp;offers a timely confrontation to such prescriptions and puts a human face on the rapidly growing crisis. Moreover, it provides a valuable perspective on the historical geography of U.S./Mexico relations, and immigration and boundary enforcement, illustrating its profound impact on people's lives and deaths. In the end, the author offers a provocative, human-rights-based vision of what must be done to stop the fatalities and injustices endured by migrants and their loved ones.<br><br>Praise for&nbsp;<em>Dying To Live</em>:</p><p>"In&nbsp;<em>Dying to Live</em>, Joseph Nevins and Mizue Aizeki have produced an important and visually moving book that adds to our knowledge of the border and its place in history. Nevins' painstaking research documents the development of the Imperial Valley&#x2014;its industrial agriculture, its divided cities, and the chasms between rich and poor, Mexican and anglo, that have marred its growth. Through the valley runs the border, and Nevins' accounts of the growth of border enforcement on the U.S. side, and the racism of its legal justifications, will be a strong weapon for human rights activists. Mizue Aizeki takes her camera and tells the story of Julio Cesar Gallegos, who died in the desert trying to make it across. Her images of the stacked bodies of border crossers held in refrigerator trucks, and the barrenness of the ocotillo cactus on the flat hardpan are eloquent testimony to the terrible risks and human costs imposed on migrants. Her beautifully composed portraits of Gallegos' family make a direct appeal to the heart in a way that words cannot. And her documentation of border protests and immigrant rights demonstrations, including the rows of jugs of water put out in the desert to save lives, are all compelling evidence that there is a struggle going on to halt the human rights crisis she and Nevins document."<br>&#x2014;David Bacon, author of&nbsp;<em>Communities Without Borders: Images and Voices from the World of Migration</em><br><br>"Joseph Nevins blows the cover off the scapegoating of 'illegal' immigrants by meticulously and grippingly compiling the history of&nbsp;why&nbsp;so many try to come to the U.S. and, tragically, why so many die. This book strikes at our very moral core."<br>&#x2014;Deepa Fernandes, author of&nbsp;<em>Targeted, Homeland Security and the Business of Immigration</em><br><br>"A fierce and courageous denunciation of the foul politics of immigration and the two-thousand mile tragedy of the Mexican border, snaking its way between two worlds, two nations, separated at birth but forever joined at the hip. Starting from one man's blackened corpse, the tale wends its way across the desert of racial amnesia to reveal the sources of America's reactionary (and futile) attempt at closure of a porous frontier. Deftly stitching together disparate times and places&#x2014;from the Imperial Valley to Zacatecas to Mexicali and back to East L.A.&#x2014;Nevins and Aizeki weave a memorial quilt to the hundreds of innocents in unmarked graves."<br>&#x2014;Richard Walker, professor of geography, UC Berkeley, and author of&nbsp;<em>The Conquest of Bread</em>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<em>The Country in the City</em>.<br><br>"<em>Dying to Live</em>&nbsp;is a compelling, perceptive and invaluable book for our times. Our new apartheid, as explored here, is as bleak and hostile as the landscapes in which people lose their lives trying merely to survive. Those lives delineated here are unforgettable."<br>&#x2014;Susan Straight, author of&nbsp;<em>A Million Nightingales</em>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<em>Highwire Moon</em><br><br>"Invisible in life, like most exploited immigrants, Julio Cesar Gallegos now judges us from the hour of his terrible death. He reminds us&#x2013;thanks to the passionate investigations of Nevins and Aizeki&#x2013;that the eyeless corpses in the Imperial Valley are murder victims: abandoned to heat, thirst, and anonymous graves by a border politics compounded of historical ignorance and contempt for human rights."<br>&#x2014;Mike Davis, author of&nbsp;<em>Planet of Slums</em>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<em>In Praise of Barbarians</em></p></p><p>Joseph Nevins authored Operation Gatekeeper: The Rise of the Illegal Alien and the Making of the U.S.-Mexico Boundary (Routledge, 2002), and A Not-so-distant Horror: Mass Violence in East Timor (Cornell University Press, 2005).

Mizue Aizeki is a documentary photographer. Her work has appeared in a variety of publications including The Wall Street Journal, ColorLines, L.A. Weekly, The Nation, The Progressive, and Z Magazine. She has also exhibited her work in several venues, including the Mission Cultural Center for Latino Arts in San Francisco.Adult/High School&#x2014;Ten years ago Julio César Gallegos, one of countless immigrants, attempted to reunite with his family in Los Angeles and died of dehydration while crossing the U.S.-Mexico border in California's Imperial Valley. In <i>Dying to Live</i>, Nevins not only tells Gallegos's story, but also presents the geographic, historical, and political context of the U.S-Mexico border. Gallegos's motivations, struggles, and sacrifices serve as examples throughout the book of both past and present social stratification, political hypocrisy, and "global apartheid." Including photographs and maps, the book details the history, policies, and economics that have driven and prevented Mexican migration to the United States. The social and economic links between the two countries are described, primarily in relation to the agricultural industry in the border states. The strength of this book lies in the wealth of research and information presented on the history and politics of the border regions of Mexico and California. Teens will not only find the author's information valuable, but will also revel in the sources presented in the bibliography. However, researchers looking for insight into migration through Mexico from other Latin American countries will not find much information in this title. The scholarly tone and depth of the material make this book best suited for advanced readers and researchers.&#x2014;<i>Lynn Rashid, Marriots Ridge High School, Marriotsville, MD</i> <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

Its brief six verses offer words of compassion, hope, and encouragement that never wear out. "Though this little psalm was written in a different time and place," says Robinson,"its lessons are as up-to-date as the 21st century.</p> <p>These ancient words, with their imagery drawn from the life and heart of David, the shepherd-king, offer incomparable hope in a complex world.</p> <p>"Trusting the Shepherd may seem easy." says Robinson as he ponders this well-loved psalm. "But anyone who tries it finds that&nbsp; life makes it hard to do." David, who himself lived life to the hilt, offers his own resounding testimony about the trustworthiness of his Shepherd. The Lord of Psalm 23 is the only one who can walk us safely through this world and into eternity. Only when we place our faith and trust in Him can we sing with David, "The Lord is my Shepherd; I shall not want." And it is then that we can affirm with conviction, based on God's promise, "I will dwell in the house of the Lord forever."</p><p>Haddon W.

Reprint.</p><p><b>Christopher Pike</b> is the author of more than forty teen thrillers, including the Thirst, Remember Me, and Chain Letter series. Pike currently lives in Santa Barbara, where it is rumored he never leaves his house. But he can be found online at ChristopherPikeBooks.com.The heavy metal aesthetic teams up with wishy-washy New Age mysticism in this reworking of the film It's a Wonderful Life. When Teresa discovers that her boyfriend Bill has dumped her in favor of her best friend, she jumps into her car and takes off into the night. On the road, the girl picks up two strange hitchhikers: the sexy magician Freedom Jack and his dour, chain-smoking companion, Poppy Corn. En route to the Bardos Club, their ultimate destination, Jack and Poppy take turns telling the tale of two star-crossed lovers while Teresa chronicles her failed romance. After a stop-over with the psychic crone Jack calls his mother, Teresa begins to suspect that her unplanned trip has led her into realms not charted on any map. With its lugubrious writing ("His wife had recently left him for a filmmaker of animal documentaries") and predictable storyline--not to mention some achingly bad song lyrics in its first section--this novel is not exactly vintage Pike. Still, the author's loyal fans may well appreciate this particular variety of watered-down spirituality. Also, the novel's life-affirming finale makes for a nice change in a genre that is often relentlessly gory.

He currently lives and works in Toronto with his wife and son.Gr 10 Up&#x2014;In this reboot of the DC Comics series, readers learn the origins of the Titans as reimagined for a new DC universe called Earth One. Four teens living seemingly normal lives in suburban Oregon have their worlds turned upside down when super powers are thrust upon them. They quickly realize that they are experiencing similar visions that seem to be related to their new powers. The young people ban together to uncover the secret behind these visions and new abilities. Little do they know that this secret will change not only their lives but the entire course of human history. This revamp of Teen Titans will appeal to avid comic book fans and readers new to the genre, making it an excellent addition to any library's graphic novel collection. Readers who have enjoyed other "Earth One" titles such as Batman and Superman, will surely enjoy this volume. It is also an excellent introduction to the those who are unfamiliar with comics and this franchise. The illustrations are vibrant and detailed. On each page, there are visual allusions to the secret which haunts each of the protagonists. The text and art will keep readers guessing until the very end. This first installment is an excellent opener to a promising graphic novel series. It does contain violence, alcohol use, and minor sexual situations, making it appropriate for older teens.&#x2014;Annalise Ammer, City of Rochester Public Libraries, NY</p><h2>Appearances: Fashion Photography Since 1945</h2><p>Traces the history of fashion photography from the end of World War II to the 1980s</p><p>Photography as a fine art is often shaped by work done in the field of fashion. As well as peddling clothes in the pages of women's magazines, fashion photographers also influence and reflect society's attitudes and obsessions. Thus, the elegant, chic, and sophisticated fashion images of the postwar period gradually evolved into the decadent, soft-porn statements typical of the 1980s and 1990s. Art historian Harrison discusses the sociological issues behind these photographic trends by examining not only the impact made by fashion photographers but also the influence of certain powerful and creative art directors. In addition, he covers the often overlooked area of male fashion, attempting to explain why this subject has received such little serious attention.The author does well in identifying the models used in each fashion shot. (Most of us have forgotten that Anjelica Huston also worked as a model.) Unfortunately, there is little new material in this book--little that was not covered in the same author's Shots of Style (Faber &amp; Faber, 1986), written as an exhibition catalog for the Victoria and Albert Museum in 1985. Although neither book is indexed (which makes anthologies of this size difficult to use), the earlier work lists the photographers alphabetically in the table of contents, while the present work does not, merely offering such vague chapter headings as "Inside" and "White Heat." Chicago readers will be disappointed that Victor Skrebneski's work is not included.

This collection combines retrospective overviews with research to achieve a multi-layered analysis of this topic. According to Professor Terence Ranger, Emeritus Rhodes Prfessor of Race Relations, University of Oxford: &#39;In some ways the historiography of Mau Mau is a supreme example not only of ambiguity and complexity but also of redemption of a topic that was once thought incapable of rational analysis.&#39; North America: Ohio U Press; Kenya: EAEP</p><p><b>E.

This book is not just about Mau Mau, or even Kenya. By comparison and implication, it addresses the issues of modern African states that were forced to follow the incredibly inappropriate European nation-state model as their only option to join the global world... As a book addressing many of the complexities of the African state and ethnicity, this collection provides new approaches, skilful writing, imaginative topics, and in-depth analyses on new dimensions and complexities of decolonization and nationalism. - Cynthia Brantley in AMERICAN HISTORICAL REVIEW This excellent and expert collection offers samples of work from the burgeoning field of Mau Mau studies, dissecting the movement's socioeconomic foundations, recruitment and survival techniques, impact on British public opinion, interpretations in Kenyan fiction, and contested symbolism in post-independent Kenyan politics. Looking back on British official responses to the movement at the time, it is hard to avoid hearing eerie echoes of contemporary American attempts to analyze and pose solutions to the threat of international terrorism. FOREIGN AFFAIRS This book represents a most welcome beginning to the fifth decade of studies of the Mau Mau rebellion...the contributions to this volume go beyond a discourse on Mau Mau and nationhood to present new and exciting insights on the military aspects of the rebellion, recruitment and survival, the struggle to contain the rebellion and rehabilitate participants and sympathisers, and impacts on imperial policy and in popular literary memory, well summed up in the book's sub-title, arms, authority, and narration. ...the new perspectives on the Mau Mau rebellion's place in Kenyan history represent outstanding contributions that will be read with profit by specialists in Kenya as well as those interested in resistance to colonial rule and its impact on British policy and Kenyan society. - Robert M.

When a member of one of York&#x2019;s most prominent families is found dead in the woods, his throat torn out, rumours spread like wildfire that wolves are running loose throughout the city. Persuaded to investigate by the victim&#x2019;s father, Owen Archer is convinced that a human killer is responsible. But before he can gather sufficient evidence to prove his case, a second body is discovered, stabbed to death. Is there a connection? What secrets are contained within the victim&#x2019;s household? And what does apprentice healer Alisoun know that she&#x2019;s not telling? <br><br> Teaming up with Geoffrey Chaucer, who is in York on a secret mission on behalf of Prince Edward, Owen&#x2019;s enquiries will draw him headlong into a deadly conspiracy.<br><br></p><p><i><b>When a prominent citizen is murdered, former Captain of the Guard Owen Archer is persuaded out of retirement to investigate in this gripping medieval mystery.</b></i><i>'Recommended for fans of other historical writers such as C.J.

Bonus round: what are the 13 grape types permitted in Chateauneuf-du-Pape?<p> Whatever your score on the above, you're bound to enjoy the <i>Windows on the World Complete Wine Course</i>. Subtitled <i>Millennium Edition</i>, this 14th annual update is again authored by Kevin Zraly, founder and teacher of the Wine School, begun in 1976 as an offshoot of New York's Windows on the World restaurant. On 200 colorful and clutter-free pages full of maps, wine labels, and sidebars full of facts and anecdotes, Zraly acts as your Sherpa through eight classes. Chapters 1 through 3 circumnavigate the white wines of France, the New World, and Germany; 4 through 8 explore the reds of France, California, Iberia, Australia, and South America, concluding with a section on champagne, port, and sherry. </p><p> As wine guru, Kevin Zraly is opinionated, knowledgeable, and patient. His skill at talking novice wine devotees off the ledge is especially evident in the chapters on Burgundy and Germany, with their notoriously confusing wine labels. Study Zraly's careful parsing and annotation of a German label and you'll be able to tell the region from the town from the vineyard the next time someone hands you a Mosel-Saar-Ruwer �rziger W�rzgarten Riesling Sp�tlese.</p><p> But any book that calls itself a "Complete Wine Course" sets the Barbera pretty high--sometimes too high. Oregon and Washington States share one page while New York State rates two and a half. Certainly a millennium edition could scare up another paragraph for the red-hot Pacific Northwest. And two chapters following the classes--"Creating an Exemplary Restaurant Wine List" and "Award-Winning Wine Lists"--seem little more than padding.</p><p> But these are small quibbles about a handsome and approachable volume that will take you from Amarone to Zind-Humbrecht with confidence. Whether you're a true cork dork or someone who doesn't know their Alsace from their elbow, you could certainly do worse than pressing your nose up against these windows on the world. <i>--Tony Mason</i></p>"If you have never bought a wine book before, start with this one.

Or the student who never says much in class may wait in the hallway with a worry she can no longer contain, "I wonder if I could speak to you for a few moments...." The person next to you on the plane may never tell you his name but will tell you his life story, "I thought we were in love, I thought it would last...." Sometimes the professional you consult -- the physician, the lawyer, the architect -- makes you into a consultant. "Sorry I&#x2019;m a little late but my mother called. She has this knack for calling at just the wrong moment...." You may be called up to serve, basic training or not, in the helping army at any moment and in almost any circumstances. You do not select them; they select you, ready or not. <p>You may never know whether they chose you because you are a member of the clergy, a professor, a nurse, or somebody who reminds them of a favorite relative. Human woe turns, as flowers do to the spring sun, to those nearby who seem capable of offering some understanding and good sense. The first murmurs of emotional pain, often disguised but ever recognizable, are almost always whispered first to such ordinary people. </p><p>If such nonprofessionals are the primary resource for our everyday troubles, what can they do to prepare themselves better to respond in such unpredictable circumstances?

Strongly recommended for fans of offbeat mysteries." &#x2015;<em>Library Journal</em> STARRED review</strong></p><p>One day, Corinna Chapman, high profile accountant and banker, walked out on the money market and her dismissive and unpleasant husband James, threw aside her briefcase, and doffed her kitten heels forever. Now she is a baker with her own business, Earthly Delights, in Melbourne, Australia, living in an eccentric building on the Roman model called <em>Insula</em> with a lot of similarly eccentric people.</p><p>She and her cat Horatio are quite content with this new life until a junkie falls half dead on her grate, a gorgeous sabra stalks along her alley telling her that she is beautiful, and threatening letters accusing her of being a scarlet woman begin to arrive. Then suddenly Goths, lost girls, fraud, late nights, nerds, and beautiful slaves complicate life for Corinna. And she still needs to get her bread out for the morning rush....</p></p><p><p>Kerry Greenwood was born in the Melbourne suburb of Footscray and after wandering far and wide, she returned to live there. She has degrees in English and Law from Melbourne University and was admitted to the legal profession on the 1st April 1982, a day which she finds both soothing and significant. Kerry has written three series, a number of plays, including <em>The Troubadours</em> with Stephen D'Arcy, is an award-winning children's writer and has edited and contributed to several anthologies. The Phryne Fisher series (pronounced Fry-knee, to rhyme with briny) began in 1989 with <em>Cocaine Blues</em> which was a great success. Kerry has written twenty books in this series with no sign yet of Miss Fisher hanging up her pearl-handled pistol. Kerry says that as long as people want to read them, she can keep writing them. In 2003 Kerry won the Lifetime Achievement Award from the Australian Association.</p>"A buxom baker and a handsome man of mystery solve a series of crimes.<br>Corinna Chapman has left her driven husband and high-pressure job to open Earthly Delights, a bakery in Melbourne. A unique Roman-style apartment house provides lodgings for her, her cat Horatio and a diverse bunch of neighbors that includes Meroe the Witch, retired professor Dionysius Monk, the Pemberthys and their spoiled dog, a Dutch lady gardener, some computer nerds and sylph-like aspiring actresses Goss and Kylie, who help in the bakery. A series of threatening letters addressed to Corinna and the other ladies in the building soon escalate to spray-painted death threats, the first on the wall of a nearby shop owned by androgynous dominatrix Mistress Dread. Corinna's life changes dramatically when she meets Daniel Cohen, an attractive man who works nights on the Soup Run delivering food to the city's homeless, and hires the homeless junkie Jason, who has an amazingly light hand with muffins, to help clean the bakery. She wonders if her ex, who's hatched a scheme to buy her apartment house and tear it down, could be the poison pen. At length, she and Daniel get to the bottom of the threats, discover who's killing off junkies with hot-shots and have a sexy adventure at the local Goth club with a vampire named Lestat.<br>Poles apart from Greenwood's popular heroine Phryne Fisher (The Green Mill Murder, 2007, etc.), but equally delightful."--Kirkus</p><h2>Robert Mitchum : Baby, I Don&#39;t Care</h2><p>A hobo during the depression, Robert Mitchum fell into acting by chance. After early success he was famously busted for smoking marijuana in the 1950s, and remained an unrepentant misbehaver until his death in 1997. This work looks at his life.</p><p>Lee Server, since graduating from New York University Film School, has written numerous celebrated works of non-fiction around film and popular culture, including Hollywood biographies Robert Mitchum: Baby I Don&#39;t Care (2002) and, most recently, a work on Ava Gardner.Robert Mitchum was one of Hollywood's original bad boys. A notorious womanizer, boozer, and brawler who was jailed in the 1950s for possession of marijuana, which only enhanced his appeal as an outlaw and an outsider, Mitchum defined the antihero before the term had been invented. And yet, as Server makes clear in this superb biography, Mitchum was also a consummate craftsman, an actor who always hit his mark (no matter what had happened the night before) and who inspired testimonials from the likes of John Huston and Charles Laughton, who believed that Mitchum could have been the era's greatest Lear. Server tells the fascinating story of Mitchum's early life, riding the rails during the Depression, and he reprises the actor's more than 100 films, providing perceptive analysis of the remarkable number of masterpieces, from the quintessential film noir, <i>Out </i> of the Past, through his groundbreaking and too-little-known western, <i>Pursued</i> , and on to the classic<i> Night of the Hunter</i> , the cult favorite <i>Thunder Road</i> , and the stellar mainstream dramas, including <i>Heaven Knows Mr. Allison</i> and <i>The Sundowners</i> . There's plenty of fascinating insider stuff about what took place on the sets of all these films, but best of all is the way Server captures the Mitchum persona: his "gliding, pantherlike movements, his underplaying and powerful silences, his expressive quiescence," and, most of all, his "immoral face." Predictably, Mitchum had nothing but scorn for such accolades, claiming he had only two acting styles: "with and without a horse." A wonderful movie-star biography about a rebel who despised movie stars. <i>Bill Ott</i><br><i>Copyright � American Library Association.

Bratt takes a look at the Dutch in America from the late 19th century to the present. A comprehensive study of an ethnic subculture, the book is in large part a study of the group's religious history as well, since, as Bratt points out, the contours of the Dutch presence in America have been overwhelmingly shaped by the church and its subsidiary organizations. / Although the book is extensively and scrupulously documented, Bratt has infused his scholarship with a considerable amount of anecdote that is by turns poignant and tragic and hilarious. / In Bratt's analysis of the fitful progress of Americanization that this close-knit religious community has undergone, we are treated to the sharp insights of a bemused and sometimes disaffected insider. Included is a chapter on novelists Arnold Mulder, David Cornel DeJong, Frederick Manfred, and Peter DeVries &#x2014; four sons of the Dutch who fled the subculture only to reflect upon it almost obsessively from the outside. / Well written, scholarly, and highly readable, Dutch Calvinism in Modern America will have wide appeal among both academic and general readers</p><p>Professor of history at Calvin College in Grand Rapids, Michigan.</p><h2>Black &amp; Decker The Complete Guide to Tile, 4th Edition: Ceramic * Stone * Porcelain * Terra Cotta * Glass * Mosaic * Resilient (Black &amp; Decker Complete Guide)</h2><p><p><b>Transform your home with confidence using our step-by-step methods for perfectly installed tile!</b></p><p>Installing tile is one of the most popular DIY projects out there.

The crime gets more personal. The stakes are raised, and nothing is as it seems.</p><p>Ridley Pearson is the author of more than twenty novels, including the <i>New York Times</i> bestseller <i>Killer Weekend</i>; the Lou Boldt crime series; and many books for young readers, including the award-winning children's novels <i>Peter and the Starcatchers, Peter and the Shadow Thieves</i>, and <i>Peter and the Secret of Rundoon</i>, which he cowrote with Dave Barry. Pearson lives with his wife and two daughters, dividing their time between Missouri and Idaho.If you stick with Phil Gigante long enough, you&#39;re bound to end up enjoying this third Walt Flemming mystery. It just takes so long to get to the heart of the story that you almost give up. The novel starts with the attempted theft of three bottles of wine allegedly given to John Adams by Thomas Jefferson. Add to that the question of whether the wine was authentic, and you have what appears to be the whole plot. Not so. With the appearance of two teenagers, an odd cast of characters, and some beautiful descriptions of Sun Valley, Idaho, your patience is ultimately rewarded. Gigante carries the ball all the way from the book&#39;s slow start to its innovative ending. Gigante&#39;s delivery commands attention, and his masterful portrayals of characters are totally convincing. This is one book better listened to than read.

Aunt Mary lived on the Gulf Coast near Biloxi, Mississippi, and whenever she felt like it, she attended the Mercy Seat Baptist Church.

And sure enough, in the hours before the preacher came to dinner, Aunt Mary would begin to purse her lips and exaggerate the pronunciation of words, as though she was waiting for a theater curtain call.</p><p>She would sprinkle a little cinnamon, or grated orange or lemon rind, on the biscuits, and stick the pan into the oven, In a few minutes the kitchen would be perfumed by a toasty aroma that lingered until late into the Sunday afternoon.</p><p>Aunt Mary's recipe:</p><p>2 cups unbleached all-purpose flour<br>1 tablespoon baking powder<br>1/2 teaspoon salt<br>1 teaspoon sugar<br>3 tablespoons vegetable shortening<br>3 tablespoons butter<br>1 cup milk<br>1 egg white, well beaten<br>1 tablespoon sugar<br>1/4 to 1/2 teaspoon ground cinnamon</p><p>Preheat the oven to 425 degrees.</p><p>Sift the flour, baking powder, salt, and sugar into a large bowl. Add the shortening and butter. Using a pastry cutter or two knives, cut in the vegetable shortening and butter until the mixture resembles coarse cornmeal.</p><p>Add the milk and stir the batter lightly with a fork. Turn the dough onto a well-floured board or pastry cloth. Add a little more flour if the dough is sticky. Knead lightly 4 or 5 times. </p><p>Roll out or pat the dough into an 8-inch circle, about 1/2-inch thick. Using a 2-inch biscuit or cookie cutter or glass rim dipped in flour, cut the dough into rounds.</p><p>Gently reroll scraps and cut again into rounds. Place the biscuits on a lightly greased baking sheet, allowing a little space between each biscuit.</p><p>Brush the tops of the biscuits with a little of the beaten egg white. Mix together the sugar and cinnamon and sprinkle on the biscuit tops. Set on the lower shelf of the hot oven and bake for 12 to 15 minutes or until golden brown.</p><p>Remove from the oven and serve hot.</p><p><b>Chicken Creole</b></p><p>Serves 4</p><p>Patricia Butler is an associate minister at the First Missionary Baptist Church in Handsboro, Mississippi, on the Gulf Coast.

IP.</p><p>Helen Knothe Nearing (1904-1995) and Scott Nearing (1883-1983) were well known American back-to-the-landers who wrote extensively about their experience living what they termed "the good life".<br><br> <p>The Nearings began their simple life on an old farm on the foot of Stratton Mountain near Jamaica, Vermont in 1932, in the pit of the Great Depression. In 1952 they moved to Maine, ultimately settling on their "Forest Farm" at Cape Rosier (in the village of Harborside, within the town of Brooksville), where they lived until their deaths. Scott remained a thinker, writer, and lecturer on economics and social issues for many years. Their best known books (those which they wrote together) are <i>Living the Good Life</i> (published 1954) and <i>Continuing the Good Life</i> (1979). The first of these is often credited with being a major spur to the U.S. Back-to-the-land movement that began in the late 1960s.<br><br></p> <p>Helen and Scott were devoted to a lifestyle giving importance to work, on the one hand, and contemplation or play, on the other. Ideally, they aimed at a norm that would divide most of a day's waking hours into three blocks of four hours: "bread labor" (work directed toward meeting requirements of food, shelter, clothing, needed tools, and such); civic work (doing something of value for their community); and professional pursuits or recreation (for Scott this was frequently economics research, for Helen it was often music - but they both liked to ski, also). They clearly honored manual work, and viewed it as one aspect of the self-development process that they felt life should be.<br><br></p> <p>The Nearings were experimenters and were also very widely read. They frequently quoted authors of centuries past in their own books. They found wisdom in some of the attitudes of the past, but did not feel tied to the life patterns or technologies of the past. Apart from the necessity that drove them to the land, when they sought a good life during the Depression, keys to their success in the lifestyle included intelligence, commitment, and self-discipline.<br><br></p> <p>Their best-known books draw mainly on their personal experience on their homesteads. Secondary content is drawn from reflections on mainstream-American society (which they were critical of and basically rejected), their neighbors, and the positive values they believed in: self-responsibility, healthy exercise and diet, social cooperation, environmental consciousness, etc. The cycles and rhythms of nature were the Nearings' guide as they successfully provided for about 80% of their food needs.<br><br></p> <p>Their approach to living, based largely on the reduction of wants and a mostly non-monetary return from their organic horticulture and other sorts of labor, appealed to many people. The Nearings offered an almost "open-house" situation on their land for several decades, so that visitors could experience this way of life and learn a bit from them. <br></p> <p><br></p></p><h2>IMAGINED COMMUNITIES: REFLECTIONS ON THE ORIGIN AND SPREAD OF NATIONALISM.</h2><p>Anderson&#39;s essay shows how the European processes of inventing nationalism were transported to the Third World through colonialism and were adapted by subject races in Latin America and Asia.</p><p><b>Benedict Anderson</b> is Aaron L.

His previous books are <i>Bread &amp; Roses</i>, which was a New York Public Library Books to Remember selection, and <i>The Man Who Changed How Boys and Toys Were Made</i>.Eighty years ago this week, the Commonwealth of Massachusetts executed two first-generation immigrants from Italy, Nicola Sacco and Bartolomeo Vanzetti, for crimes they almost certainly did not commit. Before and after the executions, passions aroused by the case, in the United States and around the world, were incredibly intense. In part, this was because the case had strong political overtones at a time when much of the country was swept up in the Red Scare. In part, it was because, as the noted newspaper columnist Walter Lippmann wrote, "No man . . . should be put to death where so much doubt exists." And, in part, it was because Sacco and Vanzetti were appealing men, whatever one may have thought of their politics. In an interview with the New York World three months before his execution, Vanzetti was quoted as saying, in halting but powerful English:<p>"If it had not been for these thing, I might have live out my life, talking at street corners to scorning men. I might have die, unmarked, unknown, a failure. Now we are not a failure. This is our career and our triumph.</p><p>Never in our full life can we hope to do such work for tolerance, for justice, for man's understanding of man as we now do by dying. Our words, our lives, our pains -- nothing! The taking of our lives -- lives of a good shoemaker and a poor fish peddler -- all! That last moment belongs to us -- that agony is our triumph!"</p><p>Later, according to Bruce Watson, "the reporter admitted he had taken hasty notes and possibly enhanced them," but that is essentially beside the point. It is only slight exaggeration to say, as Watson does, that Vanzetti's "impromptu soliloquy became immortal." Certainly it seemed so to me a quarter-century later when, as a teenager, I listened over and over again to the 1920s volume of Edward R. Murrow's "I Can Hear It Now" recordings, which included a heavily accented but deeply moving recreation of Vanzetti's words. The indignation in Murrow's own voice as he summarized the details of the case was palpable and, I feel to this day, justifiable.</p><p>This has nothing to do with sympathy for the anarchist beliefs that Sacco and Vanzetti espoused; those beliefs were naive, sentimental and simplistic. Rather it has to do with the rank injustice of their prosecution, conviction and execution. Because many Americans under the age of 50 probably know little if anything about this important case, with its broad and lasting implications, it is good to have Watson's account. The literature of the case is vast, but surprisingly little of it provides as balanced and unemotional a survey as this volume does. It is also a considerable improvement upon Watson's previous book, The Man Who Changed How Boys and Toys Were Made, a biography of A.C. Gilbert, the inventor of the Erector Set, which told an interesting story in an uninteresting way.</p><p>This time around Watson keeps his inclination toward fictionalizing in check and does solid, extensive research. He clearly sympathizes with Sacco and Vanzetti, and believes they were innocent victims of what amounted to a witch hunt, but he acknowledges that in some respects their behavior was suspect and their explanations inconsistent. Removed by eight decades from the furor, he does not succumb to the heated passions of the day, but he does convey the full extent of popular feeling. For people who need an introduction to the case, his Sacco &amp; Vanzetti will serve very well.</p><p>Similar legal controversies of somewhat more recent vintage are those of Alger Hiss, who spent almost four years in federal prison after being found guilty in 1950 on two counts of perjury involving his trial on charges of being a communist, and Julius and Ethel Rosenberg, who were found guilty of espionage and executed in 1953. All three cases took place in periods when American fears of communism and other alien political "isms" bordered on hysteria, and all aroused virulent feelings across the political spectrum.</p><p>The chief difference is that Hiss probably and the Rosenbergs almost certainly were guilty, while Sacco and Vanzetti very likely were not.</p><p>The crime they were accused of committing took place in Braintree, outside Boston, in April 1920. About "five hundred pay envelopes containing $15,776.71," the weekly pay for a local shoe factory, were stolen, and the two men carrying the money, the paymaster and a guard, were shot to death.</p><p>A "big, boxy Buick" picked up the two gunmen and raced into the distance:</p><p>"It had all been over in a minute. One crime had been committed. One car had picked up the bandits. One bandit had fired from its passenger seat. But as the crowd began to babble, a kaleidoscope of impressions swirled around the scene."</p><p>That set the pattern for the seven years to follow. There were as many accounts of the crime as there were people to testify about it, and differences between the stories were significant. What mattered most to Sacco and Vanzetti, though, was that one of two suspicious-looking men seen in Braintree -- "smoking and speaking 'a foreign language' that identified them as 'Dagos' " -- "bore a striking resemblance to Nicola Sacco." In Massachusetts at the time, that was enough. It will be difficult for today's reader to grasp, but Massachusetts in the 1920s bore little resemblance to Massachusetts today. The state that is now regarded as the epitome of liberalism and all its attendant tics was a stronghold of old Yankee conservatism: "Between the Civil War and World War I, the Commonwealth never elected a single Democratic senator nor gave a majority of votes to a Democratic presidential candidate." Its former governor, Calvin Coolidge, was in the White House by 1925, and Massachusetts thought that was just fine.</p><p>Political conservatism went hand in hand with deep prejudice against the newer residents of what was by then "the most ethnically diverse region of America," and especially against Italians, who too often were pigeonholed inside the stereotype of the Mafia. So when, a couple of weeks after the Braintree murders, Sacco and Vanzetti were apprehended in questionable circumstances in nearby Bridgewater, their arrest and prosecution were foregone conclusions. Add their well-known activism in anarchist circles and that anarchists were known to have staged bomb attacks around the country, and they never had a chance.</p><p>Their trial took place "in the peaceful little town of Dedham," under the direction of Judge Webster Thayer, who was convinced of their guilt from the outset -- he told one friend that he "would get them good and proper!" and another that they were "anarchistic bastards" -- and who gave every benefit of the doubt to the prosecution. The trial was a farce, ending in the conviction of both men: The all-male, all-white, all-Yankee jury "reached a verdict in three hours but decided it would look hasty if announced so soon."</p><p>With that verdict began six years of what Sacco called "this long and dolorous Calvary . . . this terrible and iniquitous Bastile." The men's lawyers tried various strategies and came up with everything from ballistics tests to witnesses with altered stories, but all were swatted down, first by Thayer, then by the Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court and ultimately by Gov. Alvan T. Fuller, who refused all appeals for clemency.</p><p>As one of their lawyers finally said, in sorrow and exasperation, the case "is remitted to the judgment of mankind." It has been there ever since, and arguments about what should be the correct judgment rage on to this day. The Internet is full of claims and counterclaims, declarations and speculations, to the extent that Watson must be commended for taking on a subject that is sure to bring him vilification from true believers of all viewpoints. My own view is that he has done a fair, workmanlike job, and deserves full credit for it.</p><p>Copyright 2007, The Washington Post.

In 527 CE he was made legal adviser and secretary of Belisarius, commander against the Persians, and went with Belisarius again in 533 against the Vandals and in 535 against the Ostrogoths.

The whole consists largely of military history, with much information about peoples and places as well, and about special events. He was a diligent, careful, judicious narrator of facts and developments and shows good powers of description. He is just to the empire's enemies and boldly criticises emperor Justinian. Other works by Procopius are the <i>Anecdota</i> or <i>Secret History</i>&#x2014;vehement attacks on Justinian, Theodora, and others; and <i>The Buildings of Justinian</i> (down to 558 CE) including roads and bridges as well as churches, forts, hospitals, and so on in various parts of the empire.</p><p>The Loeb Classical Library edition of Procopius is in seven volumes.</p></p><p><p>Henry Bronson Dewing (1882&#x2013;1956) was Professor of Greek at Bowdoin College and President of Athens College.</p></p><h2>Lonely Hearts of the Cosmos: The Scientific Quest for the Secret of the Universe</h2><p>Dealing with the ultimate questions of life&#39;s origins, this study examines the pride, passion, and courage of the cosmological scientists who explore the origins, stucture, and fate of the universe</p><p>In southern California, nearly a half century ago, a small band of researchers -- equipped with a new 200-inch telescope and a faith born of scientific optimism -- embarked on the greatest intellectual adventure in the history of humankind: the search for the origin and fate of the universe.

Films such as <i>Force of Evil</i>, <i>Night and the City</i>, <i>Double Indemnity</i>, <i>Laura</i>, <i>The Big Heat</i>, <i>The Killers</i>, <i>Kiss Me Deadly</i> and, more recently, <i>Chinatown</i> and <i>The Grifters</i> are indelibly American. Yet the sources of this genre were found in Germany and France and imported to Hollywood by emigr� filmmakers, who developed them and allowed a vibrant genre to flourish. <br><br>Andrew Dickos's <i>Street with No Name</i> traces the film noir genre back to its roots in German Expressionist cinema and the French cinema of the interwar years. Dickos describes the development of the film noir in America from 1941 through the 1970s and examines how this development expresses a modern cinema. Dickos examines notable directors such as Orson Welles, Fritz Lang, John Huston, Nicholas Ray, Robert Aldrich, Samuel Fuller, Otto Preminger, Robert Siodmak, Abraham Polonsky, Jules Dassin, Anthony Mann and others. He also charts the genre's influence on such celebrated postwar French filmmakers as Jean-Pierre Melville, Fran�ois Truffaut, and Jean-Luc Godard. Addressing the aesthetic, cultural, political, and social concerns depicted in the genre, <i>Street with No Name </i>demonstrates how the film noir generates a highly expressive, raw, and violent mood as it exposes the ambiguities of modern postwar society.</p><p><b>Andrew Dickos</b> is the editor of <i>Abraham Polonsky: Interviews</i> and the author of <i>Intrepid Laughter: Preston Sturges and the Movies</i>. He is also a commentator on Paramount Home Entertainment's DVD of Preston Sturges's <i>The Miracle of Morgan's Creek</i>."Dickos spins a good web for film noir addicts."&#x2015;<i>Culture Vulture</i>"<p>"Traces classic American film noir back to its antecedents in German Expressionism and the Golden Age of French Cinema in the 1930s, which have not been given their due."&#x2015;Gene D.

As a new college graduate, armed only with a philosophy degree and a singular lack of career direction, he became a valet parker for a large luxury hotel in New Orleans. Yet, rising fast through the ranks, he ended up working in &#x201c;hospitality&#x201d; for more than a decade, doing everything from supervising the housekeeping department to manning the front desk at an upscale Manhattan hotel. He&#x2019;s checked you in, checked you out, separated your white panties from the white bed sheets, parked your car, tasted your room-service meals, cleaned your toilet, denied you a late checkout, given you a wake-up call, eaten M&amp;Ms out of your minibar, laughed at your jokes, and taken your money. In <i>Heads in Beds</i> he pulls back the curtain to expose the crazy and compelling reality of a multi-billion-dollar industry we <i>think</i> we know. <br> </p><p><i>Heads in Beds</i> is a funny, authentic, and irreverent chronicle of the highs and lows of hotel life, told by a keenly observant insider who&#x2019;s seen it all. Prepare to be amused, shocked, and amazed as he spills the unwritten code of the bellhops, the antics that go on in the valet parking garage, the housekeeping department&#x2019;s dirty little secrets&#x2014;not to mention the shameless activities of the guests, who are rarely on their best behavior. Prepare to be moved, too, by his candor about what it&#x2019;s like to toil in a highly demanding service industry at the luxury level, where people expect to get what they pay for (and often a whole lot more). Employees are poorly paid and frequently abused by coworkers and guests alike, and maintaining a semblance of sanity is a daily challenge.</p><p>Along his journey Tomsky also reveals the secrets of the industry, offering easy ways to get what you need from your hotel without any hassle. This book (and a timely proffered twenty-dollar bill) will help you score late checkouts and upgrades, get free stuff galore, and make that pay-per-view charge magically disappear. Thanks to him you&#x2019;ll know how to get the very best service from any business that makes its money from putting heads in beds. Or, at the very least, you will keep the bellmen from taking your luggage into the camera-free back office and bashing it against the wall repeatedly.</p></p><p><strong>Amazon Best Books of the Month, November 2012:</strong> Always tip. If you can&#x2019;t tip, be nice. And if you can&#x2019;t manage either, you might be better off unwrapping a new toothbrush every day. That&#x2019;s just one lesson to be learned from Jacob Tomsky&#x2019;s gonzo account of his years as a front-desk clerk at hotels in New Orleans and New York. From the glad-handing doormen to the unsung workers in the &#x201c;back of the house,&#x201d; Tomsky exposes the machinery and machinations that make luxury hotels run (if not always smoothly), advising his potential guests about whose palms to grease (and how much) in order to get that coveted park-view upgrade. Informative and mildly salacious, <em>Heads in Beds</em> is an entertaining peek inside the places people go to get away, and the stunts they pull when they get there. --<em>Jon Foro<br></em> <p><b>Amazon Exclusive: An Essay by Jacob Tomsky</b></p> <p>When I started working in hotels the computer screens glowed in one color, alien green, and the monitors were the size of boulders. We used to confidently toss comment cards in the trash (or, as we referred to it, file them in the &#x201c;T&#x201d; file) making them disappear forever. I used to cash checks by picking up the phone and speaking to another human being. Music in the lobby was usually provided by a piano player, who would swivel his head at passing guests with a ridiculous, pasty-looking smile as he tapped out non-offensive cover songs played with a non-offensive classical flourish.</p> <p>Now, mid-volume, beat-heavy techno seeps from recessed speakers built into the lobby&#x2019;s crown molding. The screens are flat. You can&#x2019;t manage to direct anything from Trip Advisor into the &#x201c;T&#x201d; file and all the guests want to hook up their iPad to the toilet or whatever. And if you pay with a check I still have to pick up the phone, which is extremely irritating because who pays with checks anymore? Stop it.</p> <p>But all of that change means nothing. Because I&#x2019;ll tell you what hasn&#x2019;t changed: The front desk agents, the bellmen, the doormen, the housekeepers, the room service attendants, and the managers. Hotel employees are still version 1.0 and I guarantee if you brought me to a bar and sat me next to a front desk agent from 1897, we&#x2019;d over-drink and swap the same type of hilarious stories about the same type of insane guests. Hospitality, no matter how slick it gets, will always be a business run by people who serve people. It will always be about service. It will always take a person to explain that, no, you cannot hook up your iPad to the toilet but you <em>can</em> use it to control the lights and wirelessly play music through the in-room speaker system. And guests still, and hopefully will forever, hand me physical comment cards, which I will continue to throw in the trash.</p> <p>During all these renovations (while I said things like, &#x201c;Wait, they made the internet <em>wireless</em>? It&#x2019;s in the goddamn <em>air</em> now?&#x201d;) I was always writing. I grew up reading novel after novel and that&#x2019;s all I wanted from life, to give back and write something good. After years of hotel work and relocations that took me from New Orleans to Paris to Copenhagen and ultimately New York City, I finally conceived the idea for <em>Heads in Beds</em>. I put everything I had into it, all my knowledge of the industry and the writing skills I&#x2019;d developed since I was a child. I truly hope you find it funny and informative and that it helps you navigate the crooked halls of hospitality. That has always been my goal, to write something good.</p> <p>That and hang out with a front desk agent from 1897.</p><p>Jacob Tomsky is a dedicated veteran of the hospitality business. Well-spoken, uncannily quick on his feet, and no more honest than he needs to be, he has mastered every facet of the business, worked in many departments, and received multiple promotions for his service. Born in Oakland, California, to a military family, Tomsky now lives in Brooklyn, New York.<br><br>www.doubleday.com<br>www.jacobtomsky.com</p></p><h2>A Scanner Darkly</h2><p><p>&#x201c;Dick is Thoreau plus the death of the American dream.&#x201d;&#x2014;Roberto Bola�o<br><br>Bob Arctor is a junkie and a drug dealer, both using and selling the mind-altering Substance D. Fred is a law enforcement agent, tasked with bringing Bob down. It sounds like a standard case. The only problem is that Bob and Fred are the same person. Substance D doesn&#x2019;t just alter the mind, it splits it in two, and neither side knows what the other is doing or that it even exists. Now, both sides are growing increasingly paranoid as Bob tries to evade Fred while Fred tries to evade his suspicious bosses.</p> <p>In this award-winning novel, friends can become enemies, good trips can turn terrifying, and cops and criminals are two sides of the same coin. Dick is at turns caustically funny and somberly contemplative, fashioning a novel that is as unnerving as it is enthralling.<br></p></p><p>Mind- and reality-bending drugs factor again and again in Philip K. Dick's hugely influential SF stories. <i>A Scanner Darkly</i> cuts closest to the bone, drawing on Dick's own experience with illicit chemicals and on his many friends who died from drug abuse. Nevertheless, it's blackly farcical, full of comic-surreal conversations between people whose synapses are partly fried, sudden flights of paranoid logic, and bad trips like the one whose victim spends a subjective eternity having all his sins read to him, in shifts, by compound-eyed aliens. (It takes 11,000 years of this to reach the time when as a boy he discovered masturbation.) The antihero Bob Arctor is forced by his double life into warring double personalities: as futuristic narcotics agent "Fred," face blurred by a high-tech scrambler, he must spy on and entrap suspected drug dealer Bob Arctor. His disintegration under the influence of the insidious Substance D is genuine tragicomedy. For Arctor there's no way off the addict's downward escalator, but what awaits at the bottom is a kind of redemption--there are more wheels within wheels than we suspected, and his life is not entirely wasted. <i>--David Langford, Amazon.co.uk</i>Bob Arctor is a dealer of the lethally addictive drug Substance D. Fred is the police agent assigned to tail and eventually bust him. To do so, Fred takes on the identity of a drug dealer named Bob Arctor. And since Substance D--which Arctor takes in massive doses--gradually splits the user's brain into two distinct, combative entities, Fred doesn't realize he is narcing on himself.<br><br>Caustically funny, eerily accurate in its depiction of junkies, scam artists, and the walking brain-dead, Philip K. Dick's industrial-grade stress test of identity is as unnerving as it is enthralling.</p><h2>A Matter of Degrees: What Temperature Reveals About the Past and Future of Our Species, Planet, and Universe</h2><p>Theorizes that temperature is the most revealing method of measurement, considering such topics as the fixed internal temperature of most mammals, the significance of hydrothermal vents on the ocean floor, and the problem of superconductivity in quantum physics. 25,000 first printing.</p><p>Length and mass are measurements we understand intuitively, but temperature is fleeting and elusive. Why is it so hard to measure compared with other fundamentals? Why do living things require such a narrow range of temperatures to go about their business? How cold is deep space, anyway? Physicist Gino Segre knows how to keep interest flowing along; even when he's explaining the intricacies of small-scale physics, he takes time to ground it in real life. His scope is wide--from the beginning (and ending) of the universe to the history of life on Earth, little falls outside his purview. Yet the book touches on so many subjects of immediate interest to 21st-century humans (high fevers, sports medicine, and the next scheduled Ice Age, to name a few) that it's compelling even to those who don't care about the Big Questions. <i>--Rob Lightner</i>Gino Segr� is professor of physics and astronomy at the University of Pennsylvania. An internationally renowned expert in high-energy elementary-particle theoretical physics, Segr� has served as director of Theoretical Physics at the National Science Foundation and received awards from the National Science Foundation, the Alfred P. Sloan Foundation, and the Guggenheim Foundation. This is his first book.</p><h2>A History of the French New Wave Cinema (Wisconsin Studies in Film)</h2><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The French New Wave cinema is arguably the most fascinating of all film movements, famous for its exuberance, daring, and avant-garde techniques. <i>A History of the French New Wave Cinema</i> offers a fresh look at the social, economic, and aesthetic mechanisms that shaped French film in the 1950s, as well as detailed studies of the most important New Wave movies of the late 1950s and early 1960s.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Richard Neupert first tracks the precursors to New Wave cinema, showing how they provided blueprints for those who would follow. Jean-Pierre Melville, Alexandre Astruc, and the young Agn�s Varda all offered valuable narrative lessons and cheap production models. They were followed by Roger Vadim and Louis Malle, whose sexy story lines and lively new narrative strategies helped define a marketable, youthful cinema. But Neupert demonstrates that it was a core group of critics-turned-directors from the magazine Cahiers du Cin�ma&#x2014;especially Fran�ois Truffaut, Claude Chabrol, and Jean-Luc Godard&#x2014;who really revealed that filmmaking was changing forever. Later, their cohorts Eric Rohmer, Jacques Rivette, Jacques Doniol-Valcroze, and Pierre Kast continued in their own unique ways to expand the range and depth of the New Wave.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>A History of the French New Wave Cinema</i> captures the dramatic impact these films made upon their release, closely examining such famous movies as <i>The 400 Blows</i> (Truffaut, 1959) and <i>Breathless</i> (Godard, 1960), as well as many less-studied films, including <i>La Pointe Courte</i> (Varda, 1955), <i>Paris Belongs to Us</i> (Rivette, 1960), and <i>Le Bel Age</i> (Kast, 1964).</p><p>Richard Neupert is Josiah Meigs Distinguished Teaching Professor of Film Studies at the University of Georgia. He is the author of <i>The End: Closure and Narration in the Cinema</i> and his translations include <i>Aesthetics of Film</i> and <i>French New Wave: An Artistic School</i>.In this first history of the French New Wave to be written in English, Neupert (film studies, Univ. of Georgia) traces the development and maturation of the movement through the social, economic, and artistic atmosphere of the 1950s and 1960s and its numerous directors and supporters. He begins with forerunners like Agnes Varda and Jean-Pierre Melville and then moves on to early leaders like Roger Vadim and Louis Malle. Finally, he focuses on the critical group of Fran ois Truffaut, Jean-Luc Godard, and Claude Chabrol-onetime critics for the leading film journal Cahiers du Cinema who created some of the most innovative and exhilarating European films of the last century. Refreshingly jargon-free and full of interesting details and anecdotes, this book is a pleasure to read. Since most works treat individual directors rather than the movement as a whole, Neupert's book is highly recommended for academic libraries and large public libraries with strong film studies collections.<br><i>Andrea Slonosky, Long Island Univ.

Steel in the Storm<br>The play was quick and desperate; in the momentary illumination a ferocious bearded face shone before Turlogh, and his swift ax licked out, splitting it to the chin. In the brief, utter blackness that followed the flash, an unseen stroke swept Turlogh's helmet from his head and he struck back blindly, feeling his ax sink into flesh, and hearing a man howl. Again the fires of the raging skies sprang, showing the Gael the ring of savage faces, the hedge of gleaming steel that hemmed him in.<br>Back against the mainmast Turlogh parried and smote; then through the madness of the fray a great voice thundered, and in a flashing instant the Gael caught a glimpse of a giant form--a strangely familiar face. Then the world crashed into fire-shot blackness.<br>Consciousness returned slowly. Turlogh was first aware of a swaying, rocking motion of his whole body which he could not check. Then a dull throbbing in his head racked him and he sought to raise his hands to it. Then it was he realized he was bound hand and foot--not an altogether new experience. Clearing sight showed him that he was tied to the mast of the dragon ship whose warriors had struck him down. Why they had spared him, he could not understand, because if they knew him at all, they knew him to be an outlaw--an outcast from his clan, who would pay no ransom to save him from the very pits of Hell.<br><br>More Reading:<br>In Turlogh Dubh O'Brien Stories Series by ADB Publishing<br>&nbsp;<br>(The Original) The Dark Man <br>(The Original) The Gods of Bal-Sagoth (This Book)</p><p></p><h2>A Manual for Cleaning Women: Selected Stories</h2><p>New with book cover intact</p><p><b>Lucia Berlin</b> (1936-2004) worked brilliantly but sporadically throughout the 1960s, 1970s, and 1980s.

Familiar images abound (Ty Cobb's slide into third base, children playing sandlot ball, etc.), but the central focus is on artifacts: uniforms, scorecards and boxes of Wheaties, the bats used in record-breaking home runs and the handwritten manuscript of "Take Me Out to the Ball Game." FDR's letter urging the resumption of games after Pearl Harbor and a baseball found in the World Trade Center debris poignantly underscore America's consistent salute to and dependence upon its national pastime. But while functioning much like a museum, itself, the volume is more than simply an exhibition catalogue. Essays and stories some newly written for this collection feature dozens of writers, players and personalities from Walt Whitman to Dave Barry, Jackie Robinson to Paul Simon, and examine the game's cultural and historical significance. Readers won't find here an in-depth exploration as in Geoffrey Ward/ Ken Burns's Baseball: An Illustrated History, but the range of topics is exhaustive. The less glamorous aspects of baseball's history such as segregation and the cancellation of the 1994 World Series are given equal playing time alongside the worship of diamond deities and the celebration of the game's historical moments. This entertaining presentation, divided into groupings on baseball as ritual, freedom, opportunity and innovation, is a must for anyone who proudly echoes Tom Brokaw's sentiment as he writes "remember the final two words in our national anthem: `play ball!' " (Mar.)Forecast: Due to appear on shelves in time for baseball season, this PBS companion will sell hugely.<p></p><p>Copyright 2002 Cahners Business Information, Inc.</p></p><h2>Possession: A Romance</h2><p><br>Hailed by <i>The New York Times Book Review</i> as "a gifted observer, able to discern the exact details that bring whole worlds into being" and "a storyteller who could keep a sultan on the edge of his throne for a thousand and one nights," A. S. Byatt writes some of the most engaging and skillful novels of our time. <i>Time</i> magazine calls her "a novelist of dazzling inventiveness."<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br><b>Possession</b>, for which Byatt won England's prestigious Booker Prize, was praised by critics on both sides of the Atlantic when it was first published in 1990. "On academic rivalry and obsession, Byatt is delicious. On the nature of possession&#x2014;the lover by the beloved, the biographer by his subject&#x2014;she is profound," said <i>The Sunday Times</i> (London). The <i>New Yorker</i> dubbed it "more fun to read than <i>The Name of the Rose</i> . . . Its prankish verve [and] monstrous richness of detail [make for] a one-woman variety show of literary styles and types." The novel traces a pair of young academics&#x2014;Roland Michell and Maud Bailey&#x2014;as they uncover a clandestine love affair between two long-dead Victorian poets. Interwoven in a mesmerizing pastiche are love letters and fairytales, extracts from biographies and scholarly accounts, creating a sensuous and utterly delightful novel of ideas and passions.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>With an Introduction by the author that describes the novel's origins and its twenty-year gestation, this Modern Library edition is a handsome keepsake for fans of <b>Possession</b>&#x2014;new and old alike.</p><p>"Literary critics make natural detectives," says Maud Bailey, heroine of a mystery where the clues lurk in university libraries, old letters, and dusty journals. Together with Roland Michell, a fellow academic and accidental sleuth, Maud discovers a love affair between the two Victorian writers the pair has dedicated their lives to studying: Randolph Ash, a literary great long assumed to be a devoted and faithful husband, and Christabel La Motte, a lesser-known "fairy poetess" and chaste spinster. At first, Roland and Maud's discovery threatens only to alter the direction of their research, but as they unearth the truth about the long-forgotten romance, their involvement becomes increasingly urgent and personal. Desperately concealing their purpose from competing researchers, they embark on a journey that pulls each of them from solitude and loneliness, challenges the most basic assumptions they hold about themselves, and uncovers their unique entitlement to the secret of Ash and La Motte's passion. <p> Winner of the 1990 Booker Prize--the U.K.'s highest literary award--<i>Possession</i> is a gripping and compulsively readable novel. A.S. Byatt exquisitely renders a setting rich in detail and texture. Her lush imagery weaves together the dual worlds that appear throughout the novel--the worlds of the mind and the senses, of male and female, of darkness and light, of truth and imagination--into an enchanted and unforgettable tale of love and intrigue. <i>--Lisa Whipple</i></p><br>"Byatt is the most formidably equipped of contemporary novelists. . . . The great merit of [her] writing . . . is that it continually engages the reader's mind."<br>---<i>The Daily Telegraph </i><br>"This cerebral extravaganza of a story zigzags with unembarrassed zest across an imaginative terrain bristling with symbolism and symmetries, shimmering with myth and legend, and haunted everywhere by presences of the past. . . . Possession is eloquent about the intense pleasures of reading. And, with sumptuous artistry, it provides a feast of them."<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;---<i>The Sunday Times</i> (London)<br></p><h2>Menace from the Deep</h2><p>This is a good 5th grade book!</p><p></p><h2>The Letters of Vincent Van Gogh</h2><p>This selection of letters by Vincent van Gogh helps to elucidate not only the creative processes involved in his painting, but also the tortured soul that lay behind the genius. Covering the years 1872-1890, from his time as an employee of the Art Gallery of Goupil in the Hague, to his final tragic months in Auvers-sur-Oise, this remarkable collection provides essential reading for anyone who seeks to know the real Van Gogh. The collection includes letters to his mother, fellow artists and, most notably, his beloved brother Theo, who supported Vincent emotionally and financially throughout his short life. This new edition includes a revealing memoir by the sister-in-law of the artist, Johanna van Gogh-Bonger.</p><p>This thorough collection of van Gogh&#39;s letters has been assembled with an artful eye and sensitivity to the artist&#39;s thinking. The result is an atypical take on Vincent van Gogh that avoids putting too much stress on his troubled mental state and too much straining by the editor to shape a narrative out of van Gogh&#39;s epistolary clues. Instead, we see the thoughtful and contemplative side of this creative genius, as well as his concern for the impact his art and life had on those people closest to him.<b>Vincent Willem van Gogh</b> (1853-1890) was born in Holland. He became an assistant with an international firm of art-dealers and in 1881 he went to Brussels to study art. After an unsuccessful love affair with his cousin he returned to Holland and in 1885 he painted his first masterpiece, The Potato Eaters, a haunting scene of domestic poverty. A year later his brother Theo, an art dealer, enabled him to study in Paris, where he met Gauguin, Toulouse-Lautrec and Seurat, who became very important influences on his work.<br><br>In 1888 he left Paris for the Proven�al landscape at Arles, the subject of many of his best works, including "Sunflowers" and "The Chair and the Pipe." It was here Van Gogh cut off his ear, in remorse for threatening Gauguin with a razor during a quarrel, and he was placed in an asylum for a year. On July 7, 1890 Van Gogh shot himself at the scene of his last painting, the foreboding "Cornfields with Flight of Birds," and he died two days later.<br><br><b>Ronald de Leeuw</b> has been the director of the Van Gogh Museum in Amsterdam since 1986. He trained as an art historian at the universities of Los Angeles, California, and of Leiden, The Netherlands. As a specialist in nineteenth-century painting, he has been responsible for numerous exhibitions in The Netherlands and abroad, including the 1990 Vincent Van Gogh Centennial retrospective in Amsterdam. Since 1990 Ronald de Leeuw has also directed the Museum Mesdag in The Hague, known for its fine Barbizon and Hague School holdings. In 1994 he was appointed professor extraordinary in the history of collecting at the Free University of Amsterdam.<br><br><b>Arnold Pomerans</b> was born in 1920 and was educated in South Africa. He emigrated to England in 1948, and from 1948 to 1955 taught physics in London. In 1955 he became a full-time translator and has had just under two hundred major works issued by leading British and US publishers. Among the authors translated by him are Louis de Broglie, Anne Frank, Sigmund Freud, George Grosz, Jan Huizinga, Jean Piaget and Jules Romain.</p><h2>When the Sacred Ginmill Closes</h2><p>Already at work on two dangerous cases, Matthew Scudder, the down-and-out, hard-drinking ex-cop, becomes personally involved when the wife of a friend is brutally murdered</p><p>Lawrence Block was awarded the CWA Cartier Diamond Dagger in 2004. He is also a Grand Master of the Mystery Writers of America. He is the author of many novels and short stories and has won numerous awards for his mystery writing. He lives and works in New York City.The prolific, Edgar Awardwinning Block has written many mysteries, most in assorted series with colorful protagonists. Featured here is Matt Scudder in his follow-up appearance to Eight Million Ways to Die. Scudder is a former New York cop, now an unlicensed private detective who does favors for friends. Divorced from his wife, who lives with their sons on Long Island, Scudder rooms in a West Side hotel. His real home, however, is any one of three or four local bars, and his family are their owners, staff and habitues. In the summer of 1975, Matt is busy with assorted favors. Tommie Tillary, an investment salesman in flashy clothes, whose wife has been murdered in Bay Ridge, needs to be cleared of suspicion. The real booksas opposed to those shown to the IRSstolen from Skip Devoe's bar must be ransomed, and the masked gunmen who robbed the Morrisey brothers' after-hours place have to be identified. Drinking steadily all summer, Scudder accomplishes all of the above, his intuition, doggedness and respect for a higher law sputtering through the alcoholic haze. Block is an accomplished storyteller, and Matt Scudder is a fine example of hero as human being.

Adapted by the poet John G. Neihardt from a series of interviews with Black Elk and other elders at the Pine Ridge Reservation in South Dakota, <i>Black Elk Speaks</i> is one of the most widely read and admired works of American Indian literature. Cryptic and deeply personal, it has been read as a spiritual guide, a philosophical manifesto, and a text to be deconstructed&#x2015;while the historical Black Elk has faded from view.</p><p>In this sweeping book, Joe Jackson provides the definitive biographical account of a figure whose dramatic life converged with some of the most momentous events in the history of the American West. Born in an era of rising violence between the Sioux, white settlers, and U.S. government troops, Black Elk killed his first man at the Little Bighorn, witnessed the death of his second cousin Crazy Horse, and traveled to Europe with Buffalo Bill&#x2019;s Wild West show. Upon his return, he was swept up in the traditionalist Ghost Dance movement and shaken by the Massacre at Wounded Knee. But Black Elk was not a warrior, instead accepting the path of a healer and holy man, motivated by a powerful prophetic vision that he struggled to understand. Although Black Elk embraced Catholicism in his later years, he continued to practice the old ways clandestinely and never refrained from seeking meaning in the visions that both haunted and inspired him.</p><p>In <i>Black Elk</i>, Jackson has crafted a true American epic, restoring to its subject the richness of his times and gorgeously portraying a life of heroism and tragedy, adaptation and endurance, in an era of permanent crisis on the Great Plains.</p></p><p><b>Joe Jackson</b> is the author of one novel and six works of nonfiction, including, most recently, <i>Atlantic Fever:</i> <i>Lindbergh, His Competitors, and the Race to Cross the Atlantic</i> (FSG, 2012).

[Black Elk's] fate was to survive a rolling catastrophe with eyes wide open, his luck also his curse." <b>&#x2015;Walter Kirn, <i>Harper's Magazine</i></b></p><p>"Joe Jackson has expertly taken Black Elk&#x2019;s life<b>&#x2015;</b>as narrated by himself in the transcripts of his interviews with Neihardt<b>&#x2015;</b>and woven that together with other records and histories of him and his times. The result is that Jackson has firmly situated Black Elk in the context of Indian struggles on the plains from 1850 through 1950. He uses Black Elk to bring home the radical changes that confronted most Indians during this time and, in doing so, creates a deeply felt and personal story of loss and change on the plains . . . the long set piece concerning the Battle of the Little Bighorn is among the very best I&#x2019;ve ever read." <b>&#x2015;David Treuer, <i>The Washington Post</i></b><br><b></b><br>"Remarkably thorough . . .

In addition to seating Black Elk in his time and in the events he witnessed, Jackson gives a genuine sense of the inner man, the conflict in his soul between his Indian heritage and identity and his clear-sighted, hardnosed understanding of the compromises and capitulations necessary for his and the Lakota's survival . . . Drawing on immense research, Joe Jackson has given us the story of a man and a people whose land, way of life, and culture were the target of a concentrated project of extermination by the United States Government." <b>&#x2015;Katherine A.

With compassion and clarity, Jackson portrays Black Elk as a man haunted by his inability to make sense of the 'Great Vision' that came to him as a child . . . He brilliantly frames it with an incisive discussion of the creation of John Neihardt&#x2019;s 1932 as-told-to-book, <i>Black Elk Speaks</i>. Jackson digs into Native American culture and what it meant for Black Elk to be a holy man, especially in light of his 1904 conversion to Catholicism.

This easy-to-read, deeply spiritual introduction to Gnostic Christianity helps beginners down the Gnostic path to esoteric &nbsp;insights and wisdom. <br> <br>Focusing primarily on Sophian Gnosticism, Tau Malachi explains the origins, teachings, and nature of this living tradition. Readers also learn how to apply Gnostic practices, such as affirmation, positive thought, and creative visualization, in daily life. More than a practical guide, this text invites everyone to embark on a spiritual quest toward Spirit-connection and self-realization by way of Gnostic wisdom. <br> <br></p><p><p><strong>Tau Malachi's</strong> (Malachi eben Ha-Elijah's) spiritual journey began when he met the acquaintance of a Tau of the Sophian Tradition of Gnostic Christianity, Tau Elijah ben Miriam. He received the oral tradition of Sophian Gnosticism from Tau Elijah, and has been a student and practitioner of Gnostic Christianity for over thirty-five years. In 1983 he founded Sophia Fellowship as an expression of the tradition, and has been teaching and initiating others into Christian Gnosticism, Rosicrucian Philosophy and Christian Kabbalah since that time. He is an initiate of Ordo Sanctus Gnosis and serves as an Elder and Tau within the Sophian lineage.</p> <p>Tau Malachi is also a Chevalier (a dubbed Knight) in the International Order of Chivalric Companions, a Martinist, and is an ordained and consecrated Independent Bishop. He is co-founder of The Gnostic Apostolic Church of Sophia and is among the leading exponents of Christian Gnosticism and Kabbalah in our times.</p> <p>Along with his exploration of the Western Mystery Tradition, he has studied extensively in several Eastern Traditions, such as Vajrayana Buddhism and Vedanta, and he also studied within a Middle Eastern Tradition of Sufism, as well as becoming involved in Native American Shamanism. Though Gnostic Christianity has always been his heart's path.</p></p><h2>Lee Bontecou: A Retrospective (an exhibition catalogue)</h2><p>One of the leading female artists of the late 20th century, Lee Bontecou (b. 1931) became widely known for her welded steel sculptures and plastic and epoxy molded assemblages from the 1960s and 1970s. Her powerful and original constructions, which were both critically acclaimed and actively collected, evoked natural phenomena and organic biological life even as they grew more abstract. This monograph-the first extensive analysis of her art-presents some 50 sculptures and more than 100 drawings, including her celebrated early works as well as later pieces that are little known and have never been publicly exhibited or published. Along with four original essays, this volume also includes a reprint of Donald Judd's influential 1965 <i>Arts Magazine</i> article on Bontecou. <p>At last, through this major survey of her work-which accompanies an exhibition organized by the Museum of Contemporary Art, Chicago, and ULCA Hammer Museum-we are able to reevaluate the career of an artist who has become legendary in the art world because of the impact of her striking early work and the enormous influence she continues to have on younger artists.</p></p><p>In the 1960s, the American artist Lee Bontecou was heralded as one of the most important young artists of her time. Painstakingly crafted from castoffs--Army surplus and canvas conveyor belts from a neighboring laundry--her wall reliefs evoked a fearsome sci-fi world of black holes and bared teeth, a mysterious doom-filled terrain no one had ever seen before. In the mid-'70s, however, Bontecou disappeared from the art scene, declining to take part in exhibitions. <i>Lee Bontecou: A Retrospective</i> revisits five decades of this extraordinary artist's work. The texts include Elizabeth A.T. Smith's overview of Bontecou's career, Robert Storr's nuanced analysis of the cultural context of the work, Donna De Salvo's remarks about the otherworldly drawings, and a pivotal essay from 1965 by the sculptor Donald Judd. Especially intriguing is Mona Hadler's brief discussion of Bontecou's personal interests (insect life, model airplanes) and political beliefs. No one has much to say about the critically disparaged vacuum-formed plastic sculptures of fish and flowers from the 1970s. But Bontecou's intricate drawings and recent series of suspended sculptures, which Smith describes as "something between a helicopter and an insect," continue to explore a natural realm that combines delicacy and menace. <i>Lee Bontecou</i>, which contains 175 full-color illustrations, accompanies an exhibition of the same title at the UCLA Hammer Museum in Los Angeles through Jan. 11, 2004, which travels to Chicago and New York. <i>--Cathy Curtis</i>Elizabeth A. T. Smith, James W. Alsdorf Chief Curator at the Museum of Contemporary Art, Chicago, is the curator of this retrospective on Lee Bontecou.

K. Narayan</b> (1906-2001) was born in Madras, South India. He is best-known for his vivid fictional recreation of urban India in the Malgudi series of novels. His 1958 novel <i>The Guide</i> won him the National Prize of the Indian Literary Academy, his country's highest literary honour. In 1980 he was awarded the A.C. Benson Medal by the Royal Society of Literature and in 1981 he was made an Honourary Member of the American Academy and Institute of Arts and Letters.India's great novelist presents "a gallery of colorful characters" in this collection of short stories set in the mythical village of Malgudi.

By the end of the trials, beyond the twenty who were executed and the five who perished in prison, 207 individuals had been accused, 74 had been &#34;afflicted,&#34; 32 had officially accused their fellow neighbors, and 255 ordinary people had been inexorably drawn into that ruinous and murderous vortex, and this doesn&#39;t include the religious, judicial, and governmental leaders. All this adds up to what the Rev. Cotton Mather called &#34;a desolation of names.&#34; The individuals involved are too often reduced to stock characters and stereotypes when accuracy is sacrificed to indignation. And although the flood of names and detail in the history of an extraordinary event like the Salem witch trials can swamp the individual lives involved, individuals still deserve to be remembered and, in remembering specific lives, modern readers can benefit from such historical intimacy. By examining the lives of six specific women, Marilynne Roach shows readers what it was like to be present throughout this horrific time and how it was impossible to live through it unchanged.</p><p></p><h2>A First Dictionary of Cultural Literacy: What Our Children Need to Know</h2><p>Presents an outline of the knowledge that should be acquired by the end of sixth grade</p><p>E.D.

Those familiar with industry today know western companies are scrambling to emulate the Toyota Production System. But most don&#39;t realize that Toyota&#39;s new product development system is every bit as important to Toyota&#39;s ongoing success. If they&#39;ve heard that Toyota&#39;s development engineers are four times more productive than their western counterparts, they probably chalk it up to Toyota Production System techniques. But they&#39;re wrong in doing so. While both systems deliver extremely high productivity, and both free people to do their best, there really aren&#39;t many similarities in how the systems work. Such techniques as concurrent engineering and parallel development are used to increase options and creative possibilities while at the same time lowering the risk of failure. No company that depends on an ongoing flow of new and improved products can afford to ignore the revelations this book contains or the potential advantages in terms of productivity and creativity that can accrue from the Toyota method.</p><p>After 30 years with Texas Instruments, the author now works extensively with the National Center for Manufacturing Sciences, and companies such as General Motors, United Technologies, and Allied Signal, to enhance product development systems. This book is an outgrowth of a nationwide study involving a wide spectrum of companies to determine and document the most effective product development methodology....product development is a key to winning...a great roadmap and some tools to speed you on your way. -- <i>John H.

French author/illustrator Barroux Found A Soldier's Diary Among Some Belongings Being Discarded On The Street And Decided To Depict This Young Man's Words In The Graphic Novel Format. The Diary Covers The First Two Months Of World WarI, as seen from the perspective of a French infantryman. The story is both fascinating and frustrating, as we read about the boredom and confusion experienced by soldiers who spend most of their time walking, digging trenches, waiting for letters, looking for shelter, and wondering where the war is, exactly. Once in a while they will see a plane overhead, or hear artillery fire off in the distance, or have to hide from the enemy. Instead of the usual "big picture" focus garnered from textbooks, readers see the war as a microcosm, as told by one of its thousand moving parts. Barroux's illustrations were created with thick butcher's pencil on watercolor paper, which were then covered with a tinted varnish. The overall effect is of black-and-white drawings seen through a sepia-toned filter, which make the pictures look as old as the story itself. This volume would be most appreciated by readers looking for primary sources about World War I, as well as anyone who wants to know what it was like to be a soldier a century ago.&#x2014;Andrea Lipinski, New York Public Library</p><h2>Core Performance: The Revolutionary Workout Program to Transform Your Body and Your Life</h2><p><i>Core Performance - </i>by Mark Verstegen and Pete Williams - the breakthrough fitness program that has already shipped more than 50,000 copies in hardcover, is the first program that delivers strength and muscle mass, endurance and a lean body, balance and flexibility, athletic quickness and power--all in less than an hour a day.

He needs to pay for elder care for his mother, who&#39;s got Alzheimer&#39;s. So he comes up with the perfect scam: pretending to choke in upscale restaurants and getting &#34;saved&#34; by fellow diners who, feeling responsible for Victor&#39;s life, offer him financial support.Meanwhile, he cruises sexual addiction recovery workshops and spends his days working at Colonial Dunsboro, where his stoner colleagues are sentenced to the stocks for any deviation from the colonial lifestyle. Oh, yeah, and he&#39;s desperate to find the truth of his paternity, which his addled mother suggests may be divine.</p><p>Victor Mancini is a ruthless con artist. Victor Mancini is a med-school dropout who's taken a job playing an Irish indentured servant in a colonial-era theme park in order to help care for his Alzheimer's-afflicted mother. Victor Mancini is a sex addict. Victor Mancini is a direct descendant of Jesus Christ. All of these statements about the protagonist of <i>Choke</i> are more or less true. Welcome, once again, to the world of Chuck Palahniuk. <p> "Art never comes from happiness." So says Mancini's mother only a few pages into the novel. Given her own dicey and melodramatic style of parenting, you would think that her son's life would be chock-full of nothing but art. Alas, that's not the case. In the fine tradition of Oedipus, Stephen Dedalus, and Anthony Soprano, Victor hasn't quite reconciled his issues with his mother. Instead, he's trawling sexual-addiction recovery meetings for dates and purposely choking in restaurants for a few moments of attention. Longing for a hug, in other words, he's settling for the Heimlich.</p><p> Thematically, this is pretty familiar Palahniuk territory. It would be a pity to disclose the surprises of the plot, but suffice it to say that what we have here is a little bit of Tom Robbins's <i>Another Roadside Attraction</i>, a little bit of Don DeLillo's <i>The Day Room</i>, and, well, a little bit of <i>Fight Club</i>. Just as with <i>Fight Club</i> and the other two novels under Palahniuk's belt, we get a smattering of gloriously unflinching sound bites, including this skeptical bit on prayer chains: "A spiritual pyramid scheme. As if you can gang up on God. Bully him around."</p><p> Whether this is the novel that will break Palahniuk into the mainstream is hard to say. For a fourth book, in fact, the ratio of iffy, "dude"-intensive dialogue to interesting and insightful passages is a little higher than we might wish. In the end, though, the author's nerve and daring pull the whole thing off--just barely. And what's next for Victor Mancini's creator? Leave the last word to him, declaring as he does in the final pages: "Maybe it's our job to invent something better.... What it's going to be, I don't know." <i>--Bob Michaels</i></p>Praise for Chuck Palahniuk:<br><br>"Palahniuk is one of the freshest, most intriguing voices to appear in a long time. He rearranges Vonnegut's sly humor, DeLillo's mordant social analysis, and Pynchon's antic surrealism (or is it R. Crumb's?) into a gleaming puzzle palace all his own."<br>--<i>Newsday<br></i><br>"Palahniuk displays a Swiftian gift for satire, as well as a knack for crafting mesmerizing sentences that loom with stark, prickly prose and repetitive rhythms."<br>--<i>San Francisco Examiner<br><br></i>"Even I can't write this well."<br>--Thom Jones<br><br>"Palahniuk's language is urgent and tense, touched with psychopathic brilliance, his images dead-on accurate....[He] is an author who makes full use of the alchemical powers of fiction to synthesize a universe that mirrors our own fiction as a way of illuminating the world without obliterating its complexity."<br>--<i>L.A. Weekly<br><br></i>"Maybe our generation has found its Don DeLillo."<br>--Bret Easton Ellis<br><i>From the Hardcover edition.</i></p><h2>Goats and Sheep. A Portrait Farm</h2><p><ul><li>A selection of goats and sheep portraits in a profile, a sideward glance, or direct gaze</li></ul>When American photographer Kevin Horan moved from city to country, he found among his animal companions goats and sheep whose chorus of sounds suggested they were not just herd animals, but perhaps individuals as well. Experienced in portraiture, Horan decided to photograph them in his studio, as though they were privileged clients. The resulting images ask us to notice the variety, dignity, and personalities of these lowliest of creatures, who speak to us through the camera in a profile, a sideward glance, or direct gaze. With different coats, faces, and expressions, they are funny, fascinating, intelligent, curious, engaging "others" who command our undivided attention and respect. They remind us that we too are fellow creatures - and the camera isn't always on us.</p><p>Kevin Horan is an artist based in Langley, Washington. He earned a degree in journalism at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign before moving to Chicago. While there, he was a staff photographer for the Chicago Daily News and the Chicago Sun-Times. During the first year of the new millennium, he was one of 500 photographers who documented the city for Chicago in the Year 2000. In 2006, he moved to Whidbey Island, WA, where, in addition to befriending goats and sheep, he worked on assignments ranging from presidential campaigns to small-town life in Russia to development issues in the Amazon to following a dollar bill for a week for LIFE Magazine. He was Artist in Residence at Glacier National Park in September 2004. His images have appeared in The New York Times Magazine, Smithsonian, LIFE, U.S. News &amp; World Report, National Geographic, and numerous other magazines and books. Now a recovering photojournalist, he works on projects which look at animals as people, people as animals, and the planet as a very small place.

Tracking down the culprit pleases Fen immensely. Only the reader will have a better time.</p><p>Edmund Crispin was the pseudonym of Bruce Montgomery, an English crime writer and composer. He graduated from St John&#39;s College, Oxford, in 1943, with a BA in modern languages, having for two years been its organist and choirmaster. From 1943 to 1945 he taught at Shrewsbury School and in 1944 published the first of nine Gervase Fen novels, The Case of the Gilded Fly. He became a well respected reviewer of crime, writing for the Sunday Times from 1967 until his death in 1978. He also composed the music for many of the Carry On fims.What fun! The highlights of this book include academic and religious eccentrics, a character named Henry Fielding (who must field many questions about his famous name), and a marriage proposal beside a radish garden. Narrator Stephen Thorne enhances this delightful mystery set in England during WWII. Thorne expertly presents characters, both aristocrats and servants; quaint accents; and puns and wordplay. His delivery of the unflattering descriptions of characters is hilarious. Gervase Fen is called upon to solve the murder of a church organist who had not an enemy in the world. Was it spies? Or could it have been the witches who have been active in the village since the seventeenth century? A grand choice for those who enjoy the Golden Age of British detective fiction.

It was prettified, and the neckline of the dress, the only thing visible, was too meticulously neat to suggest her mother's usual style. She wondered whether to kiss her for the last time. But she had already kissed her for the last time -- as she lay dying. To kiss her now would be no kiss at all, because there was nothing remaining of her mother to receive it. </p><p> Mr. Bradshaw, the head of the firm of Bradshaw and Pollock, Funeral Directors, had not explicitly asked Eve if she wanted to see her mother laid out in her coffin. He had merely, after they had swapped funereal inanities, raised his eyebrows in the direction of the main laying-out room, and she had walked automatically, as if this was part of some ritual like exchanging rings at a wedding. Now, faced with the total extinction that was death, she felt nothing that she had not felt over and over again in the days since her mother died. </p><p> She had been with her when she died, sitting beside her in the hospital room. That was the important thing. </p><p> Eve shook herself and went back into the tactfully dim lighting of the main premises. She realized with a sinking heart that Mr. Bradshaw was preparing to be chatty. </p><p> "She'll be much missed," he said, as if he had just thought it up. </p><p> "I shall certainly miss her," Eve said, trying to be conversational, "even though we lived a fair way apart with me in Wolverhampton and her here in Crossley. We always talked to each other every week, twice a week if anything noteworthy had occurred. And we wrote quite often, particularly if it was something that was difficult to put into words." </p><p> "I remember very well when Mrs. McNabb first came to Crossley," said Mr. Bradshaw, perching himself on an empty coffin with a price tag on its lid. "I was within an ace of taking Betty, that's my eldest, out of the primary school and sending her to a private one. Then someone told me that he'd met the new teacher who was said to be going places, and who seemed enormously competent -- knew what she wanted and how she wanted to achieve it. After I'd talked to your mother for a few minutes at a parents' evening, I decided to give the school a go for another year. I never regretted it, and there's a lot of parents about that time who did like me and would say the same." </p><p> "I'm so glad," said Eve, wondering when she could legitimately plead busyness and end the conversation. "I think she found being deputy rather difficult. She liked -- not being in charge exactly -- " </p><p> "No, no." </p><p> " -- but being able to take a lead, take people along with her. She even liked the maneuvering that convinced people they were part of the decision-making process. And she liked the compromises that had to be made, because she didn't want the reputation of being a one-woman band." </p><p> "I think it was her human side that made her such a good head. There was so often a glint in her eye." </p><p> "I think it was a Scottish sort of humor," said Eve. Then suddenly she thought: the woman we are talking about and the woman I loved and remember are two different people. And really I don't give a damn about the public woman. It's not <i>her</i> I feel like crying for. She smiled at Mr. Bradshaw. </p><p> "Well, I must get going. Always a mountain of things to do when something like this happens. The post is piling up. I am grateful to you for all you've done." </p><p> As she went out into the discreet Crossley side street, a passing man looked at her, nodded, and murmured something that was obviously a condolence or a tribute to her mother. Eve smiled her thanks and walked on -- briskly, repelling any further encounters. It was time to concentrate on the private woman May McNabb. </p><p> When she got to Derwent Road, she slowed to a halt as she neared the house where she had grown up. Number 24 loomed rather pushily over the houses around and opposite it. It was an Edwardian product, with large rooms, a study and five bedrooms: it had been built for a substantial bigwig in the small town of Crossley, and it had been designed to impress. Size was of the essence and was not something to be apologized for. The garden, entirely cared for by May McNabb until an occasional help had been engaged in the last months, stretched comfortably on all four sides of the house. How had her mother and father afforded this house, back in the seventies, when salaries in teaching were derisory? Maybe a legacy, maybe her father's cartoons had brought in money. Eve shook herself and walked on. </p><p> But before she could get into the home that she had shared with her mother for the first twenty years of her life, there was the neighbor in the garden. She had been there and shown signs of wanting to talk when Eve had come out earlier in the afternoon, but Eve had used her appointment with Mr. Bradshaw as an excuse, and felt that now she ought to have a few words. Mrs. Calthorp was a woman her mother had liked and respected, and she had always been good when her mother had taken a well-deserved holiday -- fed the cat, collected the post, even done a bit of weeding if her mother had been away a long time. Eve stopped at her front gate. "Well, that's over," she said to the stooping form. </p><p> "Was it awful?" asked Mrs. Calthorp, straightening up. </p><p> "Not exactly. But I felt pressured to go and see the body. I suppose it's usual, and we do usual things at such a time. But I didn't want to. It was meaningless. I had seen her die." </p><p> "I know what you mean. I thought I ought to when Harold died. People even said the grandchildren ought to go, but I put a stop to <i>that</i> idea. You're quite right. It's just a charade." </p><p> "Now I want to sit down and cherish memories of her <i>alive</i>." </p><p> "I'm sure there'll be a lot of those. You were so close." </p><p> "Yes, we were. But somehow these last years, it's been difficult to <i>be</i> close. Her having school holidays and me never being able to get off then because of having to give priority to people with young children." </p><p> "Still, there were all the times you came back here, and all the weekends away." </p><p> "Those were nice, especially the weekends. Little festivals here and there. We found some good ones and some really odd ones. We'd have done much more of that sort of thing if only she'd had longer in retirement. And her keeping quiet about the breast cancer didn't help. Oh well..." </p><p> Eve went through her own gate and started toward the front door. </p><p> "The postman's been. Another big bundle for you," said Mrs. Calthorp, bending down. </p><p> Eve let herself into the house she had grown up in. She stepped over an untidy mess of envelopes on the doormat and went through to the kitchen. She needed so much to have a cup of tea and time for thought. The making of tea and the finding of biscuits helped, but then when she sat down in the sitting room, in her own old threadbare armchair, the thought came back to her: I only knew part of my mother -- the private area. The headmistress part meant nothing to me, but it meant everything to most of those who knew her. Quite rightly she found another school for me to go to, not her own. But even the private area of her life I didn't know all that well. Visits home, phone calls, weekends at Buxton or Garsington -- what did they amount to? We could have had such a good time now that she had reached sixty-five. Gone around together, made discoveries about each other. The process was beginning in the six months after she retired. And then the beastly cancer intervened -- suddenly, and quickly deadly. </p><p> She fetched the post and began to open the envelopes. Mostly short missives about how sad people were, how much her mother had meant to them, how wonderfully she had turned around the Blackfield Road Primary School. All of the messages heartfelt, this Eve felt sure of. There were hardly any purely formal condolences. The longer ones usually mentioned one or two special memories of her mother -- as teacher, headmistress or just as a sympathetic and enterprising human being. Eve had to admit that many of the anecdotes caught the essence of her mother in her public role. </p><p> She was nearing the end of her task, with two piles on the floor beside her: those needing answers and those that did not. She picked up an envelope that had been near the bottom of the raggedy pile she had taken up from the doormat. It was fatter than the earlier ones, with a fierce animal on a first-class stamp and, as usual these days, an illegible postmark. She opened it and found four small pages of very flimsy paper covered with large, clear script. When she read the inscription she realized with a shock that the writer was not one of those who wanted to pay tribute to a dead woman. </p><p> Dearest May, </p><p> It seems ages since we've been in touch, and I can only explain the scrappiness of my letters by pleading the extreme busyness of someone who has madly taken up this and that these last few years, and has less time than she ever had in her life before. Don't do anything as silly now that you have retired! </p><p> My activities are easily cataloged, though they take up so much of my time. Apart from all my church work, which I've told you about before, I am a school governor, I am secretary to the local Green Party and I dabble as often as I am asked and can manage it in amateur dramatics. People say that there are few parts for older women, but I think they must mean few good parts, few long, meaty ones. I am now into my third production of Hay Fever. In the first I played Myra, in the second I played Judith Bliss, and now I'm going to play Clara the old maid. Plenty of meat in that part if you know how to dig for it. But how amateur dramatics do bring home to one the passing of time! </p><p> But sometimes, you know, it's as if time has not passed at all, and we are back, together again and happy as sand boys. Often at night I dream of you being beside me in bed, with your lovely enticing body throwing out invitations even in sleep. We were the most wonderful pair, May; two people who had to come together because p...</p></p><h2>The Collected Poems of W. B.

By the early 1900s, however, he was moving away from plush romanticism, his verse morphing from the incantatory rhythms of "I will arise and go now, and go to Innisfree" into lyrics "as cold and passionate as the dawn." At every stage, however, Yeats plays a multiplicity of poetic roles. There is the romantic lover of "When You Are Old" and "A Poet to His Beloved" ("I bring you with reverent Hands / The books of my numberless dreams..."). And there are the far more bitter celebrations of Maud Gonne, who never accepted his love and engaged in too much politicking for his taste: "Why should I blame her that she filled my days / With misery, or that she would of late / Have taught to ignorant men most violent ways, / Or hurled the little streets upon the great, / Had they but courage equal to desire?" There is also the poet of conscience--and confrontation. His 1931 "Remorse for Intemperate Speech" ends: "Out of Ireland have we come. / Great hatred, little room, / Maimed us at the start. / I carried from my mother's womb / A fanatic heart." <p> Yeats was to explore several more sides of himself, and of Ireland, before his <i>Last Poems</i> of 1938-39. Many are difficult, some snobbish, others occult and spiritualist. As Brendan Kennelly writes, Yeats "produces both poppycock and sublimity in verse, sometimes closely together." On the other hand, many prophetic masterworks are poppycock-free--for example, "The Second Coming" ("Turning and turning in the widening gyre / The falcon cannot hear the falconer; / Things fall apart; the centre cannot hold; / Mere anarchy is loosed upon the world...") and such inquiries into inspiration as "Among School Children" ("O body swayed to music, O brightening glance, How can we know the dancer from the dance?"). And at his best, Yeats extends the meaning of love poetry beyond the obviously romantic: love becomes a revolutionary emotion, attaching the poet to friends, history, and the passionate life of the mind. <i>--Kerry Fried</i></p>RICHARD J.

It went like this:</i></p> <p><i>Curiosity killed the cat</i></p> <p><i>Satisfaction brought him back</i></p> <p><i>I am a curious person. I was just as curious back in my early days in Vaarn as I am now, perhaps even more so, because my curiosity had not yet been given a chance to be satisfied.</i></p> <p><i>The first time I heard this expression, I was very excited. I thought it meant that my curiosity could make me feel like I was dying, but it would let up if I discovered the answer to whatever was making me curious.</i></p> <p><i>I told my mother about the rhyme. She was not impressed. In fact, she looked at me as if I had just set my own hair on fire on purpose. She patted my chin, which was woefully free of any sign of the beard that should have been growing there.</i></p> <p><i>&#x201c;That&#x2019;s very nice,&#x201d; she said, returning to her chores. &#x201c;But just in case nobody told you, you are not a cat, Ven. Unlike you, cats have whiskers.&#x201d;</i></p> <p><i>My pride stung for days afterward.</i></p> <p><i>But it didn&#x2019;t stop my curiosity from growing as fast as my beard should have been.</i></p> <p><i>My name is Charles Magnus Ven Polypheme, Ven for short. Unlike the human boys in Vaarn, I am of the race of the Nain. Nain are somewhat shorter than humans, and grumpier. They live almost four times as long as humans, and tend to be much less curious, and much less adventurous. They hate to travel, don&#x2019;t swim, and generally do not like other people. Especially those who are not Nain.</i></p> <p><i>I clearly am not a good example of my race.</i></p> <p><i>First, I am very tall for a Nain, sixty-eight Knuckles high when I was last measured on the morning of my fiftieth birthday. I&#x2019;ve already mentioned my uncontrollable curiosity, which brings along with it a desire for adventure. I have been blessed, or cursed, with quite a lot of that recently.</i></p> <p><i>But as for the curiosity, while I&#x2019;ve had a lot of satisfaction for the questions it has asked me, it doesn&#x2019;t seem to matter. As soon as one burning question is answered, another one springs to mind immediately. As a result, I am frequently in trouble.</i></p> <p><i>So now I am about to lay my head on a chopping block, </i><i>on purpose</i><i>, and a man with a very sharp knife is standing over me, ready to make slashes in my neck.</i></p> <p><i>I&#x2019;m wondering if in fact instead of being a live Nain, I am about to end up as a dead, formerly curious cat.</i></p> <p><i>Because now I have three whiskers of my own.</i></p> <p>Ven Polypheme had two sets of eyes staring at him.</p> <p>One set was black as coal. The other was green as the sea.</p> <p>Neither of them looked happy.</p> <p>The green eyes were floating, along with a nose, forehead, and hair on which a red cap embroidered with pearls sat, just above the surface of the water beneath the old abandoned dock. The brows above the eyes were drawn together. They looked annoyed.</p> <p>The black ones were in the middle of the face of his best friend, Char, who stood beside him on the dock. They looked anxious.</p> <p>In the distance a bell began to toll. Ven looked to his left at the docks of the fishing village to the south of them, where work had begun hours ago. Then he looked behind him. The sleepy town of Kingston in the distance was just beginning to wake up.</p> <p>Ven looked back down into the water.</p> <p>&#x201c;Come on, Amariel,&#x201d; he said to the floating eyes. &#x201c;I can&#x2019;t really go off into the sea without him.&#x201d;</p> <p>A glorious tail of colorful scales emerged from below the surface, splashing both boys with cold salt water.</p> <p>&#x201c;Why not?&#x201d; a girl&#x2019;s voice demanded from the waves. &#x201c;He&#x2019;s a pest. And he isn&#x2019;t nice to me.&#x201d;</p> <p>Char&#x2019;s black eyes widened.</p> <p>&#x201c;I&#x2014;I&#x2019;m sorry &#x2019;bout that,&#x201d; he stammered. &#x201c;When I first met you, Ven didn&#x2019;t tell me you were a mermaid&#x2014;&#x201d; He shivered as another splash drenched him again. &#x201c;Er, I mean <i>merrow</i>. I&#x2019;m sorry if I made you mad.&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;Hmmph.&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;Please let him come,&#x201d; Ven said. &#x201c;Captain Snodgrass gave him orders to keep an eye on me. So if I&#x2019;m going to explore the sea with you, he kinda has to come along.&#x201d;</p> <p>Char nodded. &#x201c;Cap&#x2019;n&#x2019;s orders.&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;He&#x2019;s not <i>my</i> captain,&#x201d; said the merrow. &#x201c;I don&#x2019;t take orders from humans. You know better, Ven. My mother will fillet me if she finds out I&#x2019;m traveling with a human male. <i>Especially</i> if we are going to go exploring. There are very clear rules about not showing humans around the wonders of the Deep. And besides, it&#x2019;s dangerous. You have no idea how many sea creatures think humans are tasty. I don&#x2019;t want to get chomped on by mistake.&#x201d;</p> <p>Out of the corner of his eye, Ven watched Char&#x2019;s face go white.</p> <p>&#x201c;We&#x2019;ll be careful,&#x201d; he promised. &#x201c;Char will be on his best behavior.&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;I&#x2019;ve seen his best behavior. I&#x2019;m not impressed.&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;Look,&#x201d; Char said. &#x201c;If you get sick of me, you can always cover me with fish guts and toss me out as shark bait.&#x201d;</p> <p>The merrow stared coldly at him.</p> <p>&#x201c;Oh, all <i>right</i>,&#x201d; she said finally. &#x201c;But remember, there&#x2019;s a reason they call bait for sharks <i>chum</i>. &#x2018;Chum&#x2019; is another word for &#x2018;friend.&#x2019;&#x201d; Her eyes stayed locked on Char. &#x201c;And if you make a bunch of sharks angry, <i>Chum</i>&#x2014;&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;I&#x2019;ll be chum,&#x201d; Char said. &#x201c;Got it.&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;So if you&#x2019;re coming, we have to find a fisherman named Asa with a red-bottomed boat.&#x201d; Amariel pointed south to one of the far docks. &#x201c;He&#x2019;ll cut your gills, and we can get going.&#x201d;</p> <p>Both boys grabbed their necks.</p> <p>The merrow rolled her eyes. &#x201c;Oh, come <i>on.</i> Do you want to be able to breathe underwater or not? Gills are the only way I know of to do that. I&#x2019;m tired of waiting. Decide whether you&#x2019;re coming or whether I&#x2019;m leaving.&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;We&#x2019;re coming,&#x201d; Ven said as he let go of his neck. &#x201c;Sorry&#x2014;it&#x2019;s just instinct. Let&#x2019;s go.&#x201d;</p> <p>Char nodded, but did not remove his hands.</p> <p>The merrow disappeared below the surface of the water.</p> <p>The two boys hurried south over the packed sand along the shore.</p> <p>&#x201c;Ya know, it&#x2019;s not too late to change your mind, Ven,&#x201d; Char muttered. &#x201c;We could get a boat or somethin&#x2019;, and follow her out to sea, like we did when we were chasing the Floatin&#x2019; Island, and then <i>dive</i> down to see whatever she wants to show us&#x2014;&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;You can stay on shore if you want to, Char,&#x201d; Ven said, trying to see the merrow in between the waves. &#x201c;But I promised her a long time ago that I would explore her world with her. It&#x2019;s now or never.&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;Have it your way,&#x201d; Char said gloomily. &#x201c;You always do anyway.&#x201d;</p> <p>They followed the pebbly path in the sand south until the fishing village came into sight. Several long piers led out into the harbor, with docks along each of them. Small boats lined the docks. At each boat fishermen were hauling nets filled with flapping fish and cages with crabs and lobsters onto the piers. Seagulls flew in great wide circles above, screeching and crying, then diving for food.</p> <p>&#x201c;So how did she happen to find this Asa, and how does she know he won&#x2019;t just cut our throats?&#x201d; Char asked as they picked their way among barrels and pieces of rope on the slats of the pier.</p> <p>Ven shrugged. &#x201c;No idea. But sailors and merrows have a pretty good connection.&#x201d; He pointed about halfway down the pier, where a small green fishing boat with a red bottom bobbed lazily in the morning tide. A wrinkled man in a wrinkled hat sat on a barrel at the edge of the dock, cleaning his morning catch of fish. &#x201c;Could that be him?&#x201d;</p> <p>Char squinted. &#x201c;I guess so.&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;Come on. We may as well ask. If it&#x2019;s not Asa, he probably knows where to find him. Fishermen all know each other.&#x201d;</p> <p>The two boys walked along the pier, stepping out of the way of men dragging lobster traps and heavy netting, until they got to the red-bottomed boat. They stopped behind the elderly fisherman, who did not seem to notice they were there.</p> <p>Ven coughed politely.</p> <p>&#x201c;Excuse me, sir&#x2014;are you Asa?&#x201d;</p> <p>The fisherman looked up from his work, his sky-blue eyes twinkling in the sun.</p> <p>&#x201c;Who&#x2019;s askin&#x2019;?&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;Er, my name is Ven, sir. I was told I might find a fisherman at this dock who could, uh, cut gills.&#x201d;</p> <p>The wrinkly man nodded. &#x201c;Well, <i>Ven,</i> you&#x2019;ve found &#x2019;im. But I can&#x2019;t say as I&#x2019;ve heard of any recent wrecks.&#x201d;</p> <p>Ven blinked. &#x201c;Pardon?&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;Shipwrecks,&#x201d; said the fisherman. &#x201c;That&#x2019;s the only reason I know of for a man to risk a slice in his neck&#x2014;to salvage the treasure from the bones of a shipwreck.&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;Oh.&#x201d; Ven and Char exchanged a glance, then looked off the edge of the dock.</p> <p>In the water behind the boat, the beautiful tail of multicolored scales was waving at them from beneath the surface.</p> <p>&#x201c;Uh, we weren&#x2019;t really planning to dive for treasure,&#x201d; Ven continued, trying to block the sight of the merrow&#x2019;s tail. &#x201c;We just want to do some exploring.&#x201d;</p> <p>The fisherman&#x2019;s eyebrows arched.</p> <p>&#x201c;The sea&#x2019;s no place to explore without a good reason, lads,&#x201d; he said seriously. &#x201c;Lots of bad stuff down there&#x2014;believe you me. The only reason a man takes his life into his hands on a daily basis by going out there is to make a living for his family. Otherwise, we&#x2019;d farm the land.&#x201d; The blue eyes twinkled. &#x201c;If we knew how.&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;Well, we&#x2019;d really like to have gills, nonetheless,&#x201d; Ven said. &#x201c;We&#x2019;ve been told you know how to, er, cut them without too much pain&#x2014;and safely. Is that true?&#x201d;</p> <p>Asa exhaled, then nodded.</p> <p>&#x201c;I suppose that depends on how much is too much where pain is concerned,&#x201d; he said. &#x201c;That&#x2019;s really up to you. It&#x2019;s not my business what you&#x2019;re doing. We mind our own business on the sea. If you want gills, and you&#x2019;re willing to take the risk, I can cut &#x2019;em for you right quick.&#x201d; He held up a thin silver filleting knife. &#x201c;Then I have to get back to cleaning my catch. So, what&#x2019;ll it be?

Hugo is the author of &#34;Les Miserables&#34; and the creator of the Hunchback of Notre Dame. He came to symbolize the revolution in French literature which overthrew the structures of classicism for the Romanticism of the late-19th century.</p><p>It's easy to see why <i>Victor Hugo</i> won the 1997 Whitbread Biography Award. Unintimidated by the epic sweep of Victor Hugo's life (1802-85), British scholar Graham Robb analyzes it with intelligence, wit, and enormous verve. The author wears his learning lightly as he cherry-picks the vast Hugo archives to cogently chronicle his subject's evolution from leading poet of the Romantic revolution (<i>Hernani</i>) to passionate novelist of the downtrodden (<i>The Hunchback of Notre Dame</i>) to majestic political exile (<i>The Chastisements</i>), thundering against the tyranny of Louis-Napoleon from the Channel Islands. <i>Victor Hugo</i> is a stimulating, opinionated reassessment of France's most monumental writer.&#34;Victor Hugo&#34; was shortlisted for the 1998 Los Angeles Times Book Award in Biography.</p><h2>The Forbidden (The Last Gunfighter, Book 4)</h2><p>After his life is destroyed by brutal outlaws, Frank Morgan, determined to lead a solitary and peaceful existence, finds himself in the middle of a Montana range war, rife with fear and hatred, where he must choose sides and fight for the land.

Outlaw Frank Morgan wants to find some peace and quiet in his once-busy life but instead finds himself torn between two feuding factions. Featuring remarkable and realistic sound effects and a large cast of talented narrators--including Ken Jackson, Steve Carpenter, Mort Shelby, Nanette Savard, Nathanial Perry, and Richard Rohan--this recording is a rousing adventure that will transport listeners to the Wild West.

It is capable of endless subtleties; fragile or strong, it can be transparent as ice, opaque as marble, in love with light as a diamond.<br>Now the secrets of using this most challenging color is explored and shared by the editors of Victoria magazine in At Home with White. More than 150 beautiful photographs feature the many decorating styles created or enhanced by the color of white - richly traditional, clean-lined contemporary, rustic country, breezy tropical, lushly romantic. Victoria takes us on an informative tour of the exquisite fabrics that bring these styles to life, from hardworking cottons to sophisticated linens to precious laces. We are invited into the wonderful, magical world of summer, a season that seems as if it were created expressly for white, and into the private places in our homes made intimate and fresh with white - bedroom, bathroom, dressing room. The white gardens, porches, and terraces that serve as refuges in our lives are explored, as is the long-standing friendship between white and blue. Throughout the book are profiles of homeowners who have spun some magic of their own with this most intriguing color.</p><p>Now entering its fifteenth year, America's Victoria magazine celebrates the beauty and creativity that women bring to their homes and their world. Every issue is filled with inspiring ideas for decorating, romantic fashions, enchanting gardens, elegant entertaining, travel, and profiles of entrepreneurs who've followed their passions to success. Victoria speaks to the heart of women's lives.

White is positive, assertive, and highly visible. Over the centuries, its power has been understood and exploited. Ever sage, Queen Elizabeth I, when visiting her courtiers, stepped from boat or coach clothed in radiant, silver-threaded white so she would stand apart from her attendants and the welcoming throng. </p><p>A Palette of Seashells </p><p>A house near the sea carries its own special obligations. The interior must reflect the light from the expansive sky, the fleeting clouds that forecast the day's occupations, and the distant roar of the ocean that is a constant reminder of the shore with its glistening, tufted grasses, undulating sand, and thousands of tinted seashells scattered there. </p><p>The open living room of Susan Becher's house on Long Island is made to seem more open still by white moldings and floors, and by the subtle shade of vanilla paint on the walls. Easy-going blue and white striped slipcovers, a dash of white lace on chair backs and tables, and a hardy sisal rug make the room a year-round ode to summer. </p><p>Copyright 1996 The Hearst Corporation</p></p><h2>Last Night&#39;s Fun: In and Out of Time With Irish Music</h2><p>Each chapter the title of a traditional tune, a celebration of Irish music examines the history, experience, and meaning of the music</p><p>Reading these essays by an Irish folk musician, you are drawn in and transported, and it begins to seem that you can hear the fiddles and <i>bodhrans</i>, and you can almost smell the Guinness. Ciaran Carson, who has published several books of poetry, spent many years playing traditional Irish music in pubs with sawdust on the floor, and he evokes both scene and sound brilliantly in prose. We're lucky that the talented Mr. Carson takes time to put down his flute and pick up the pen. Anyone who appreciates folk music, or anyone who just likes fine writing, will enjoy this wondrously quirky little book.Ciaran Carson was born in 1948 in Belfast and works for the Arts Council of Northern Ireland. He is the author of The Pocket Guide to Irish Music, The Star Factory, as well as five collections of poetry, one of which, First Language, was awarded the T.S.

He came to England in 1919 and was educated at St Paul&#39;s School and Corpus Christi College, Oxford.

Set in contemporary India, where rich men are gods while farmers starve and water is fast running out, <i>We That Are Young </i>is a story about power, status, and the love of a megalomaniac father. A searing exploration of human fallibility, Preti Taneja&#x2019;s remarkable novel reveals the fragility of the human heart&#x2014;and its inevitable breaking point.</p><p>Preti Taneja was born in England to Indian parents. She has worked with youth charities, with refugees, and in conflict and post-conflict zones on minority and cultural rights, and&nbsp;teaches writing in prisons and universities. She is the co-founder of the advocacy collective ERA Films and of Visual Verse, an online anthology of art and words. <i>We That Are Young</i> won the 2018 Desmond Elliot Prize for the UK&#x2019;s best debut novel and was nominated for numerous international awards, including the Folio Prize, India&#x2019;s Shakti Bhatt First Novel Prize, and Europe&#x2019;s most prestigious award for a work of world literature, the Prix Jan Michalski.i<br><br><i>It&#x2019;s not about land, it&#x2019;s about money.</i> He whispers his mantra as the world drops away, swinging like a pendulum around the plane. The glittering ribbon of the Thames, the official stamps of the Royal parks, a bald white dome spiked with a yellow crown, are swallowed by summer&#x2019;s deep twilight. The plane lifts, the clouds quilt beneath it, tucking England into bed to dream of better times. It is still yesterday, according to his watch. He winds the dial forward. Now it is tomorrow, only eight hours to go.<br><br>He&#x2019;s landed the window seat with the broken touchscreen: it&#x2019;s either in-flight information or <i>Slumdog Millionaire</i>, the last movie he ever took Ma to. They went on release weekend. The entire line of people had been brown, so for once Ma didn&#x2019;t hunch in his shadow as if his jeans and camel coat would protect her, explain her. Instead they had the same old fight about Iris, and as he bought toffee popcorn she began to sniff: she said she was catching a chill. She kept up the sniffing as the credits rolled over the entire cast line-dancing on the set of an Indian train station. When they got outside, he thought she&#x2019;d been crying. He put his arms around her: her head was the perfect place for his chin to rest. He asked her if she liked the movie, she said she didn&#x2019;t at all. It was not real India, except for the songs.<br><br>It&#x2019;s been a long haul from JFK to the LHR stopover. He&#x2019;s half shot with the comfort of Johnnie Walker, knows it&#x2019;s not the best but he appreciates the label. It feels bespoke to him, like a child in a gift shop who finds a mug with his own name on it. No gift shop in America has a JIVAN mug so he borrowed JON, and that&#x2019;s been it since he did this trip the other way. Thirteen years old: sold on leaving India by the promise of his first time in the air.<br><br>Forward, forward, he wills the plane, drumming his hands on the tray-table, earning himself the side eye from the woman wedged into the seat next to him. She&#x2019;s using her iPhone 4 to photograph the back page of the in-flight magazine: <i>Ambika Gupta: offering you the miracle of advanced Numerology: a digit for your future</i>. She pokes the man on her other side: Sardarji in a blue turban, matching jersey stretched over his belly, stitched with a white number 5. Dude looks like he&#x2019;s birthing quintuplets under there. She smiles at him, sits back in her seat. There are thin red lines traced all over her hands in fading bridal henna as if she&#x2019;s been turned inside out, painful, beautiful, the pattern of her is all paisleys. Her ring is a platinum band with a square-cut white diamond and her bag is Longchamps like all the pretty-pretty girls have; navy waterproof with brown leather trim, but small, the cheapest. <i>Don&#x2019;t you know, pretty girl, that no bag is better than trying too hard?</i> She&#x2019;s flicking through the magazine: ads for Marc Jacobs, Charlize Theron, flicks to the gadgets, flicks to the movies, <i>clink-chime-clink </i>go the red glass bangles stacked up her wrists.<br><br>It sounds like the overture to Ma&#x2019;s practice music. Played for her to dance Kathak, with precision, while Jivan kept time. Fist thumping into palm, <i>Dha-din-din-dha</i>. His memories are coloured by her last months&#x2014;Ma, fading from brown to yellow, a bruise that would not heal against the hospital white. <i>Dha-din-din-dha</i> became her fingers beating lightly on his temples&#x2014;blurring into the rattle of her breath toward the end&#x2014;the background hum of the plane&#x2019;s engine in his ears. They are cruising high over the mountains of who knows where.<br><br>He pulls out his own magazine. The cover is a cartoon illustration&#x2014;a tiny brown body topped with an oversized head. Under a halo of white hair, two puffed cheeks blow out candles on a vast birthday cake the shape of an udder. India, sprouting with the turrets of heritage hotels, factory chimneys. Cars race off its surface, bolts of cloth unfurl, tigers hunt goats through spurting oil rigs. The orange headline shouts: <i>Happy 75th Birthday Devraj Bapuji!</i> The spotlight falls on the wily old face. <i>This </i>man, on <i>this </i>cover, on <i>this </i>flight&#x2014;this is what Ma would have called a sign.<br><br>&#x2014;Sir, beverage?<br><br>The airhostess is white bread, plum jam lickable; her smile promises drinks, upgrades, a hand to hold if the plane goes down. Jon wants to show-and-tell the magazine to her, <i>Hey, my real name is Jivan! When I was a kid, I knew this guy! He is Bapuji, my half brother&#x2019;s Godfather. He&#x2019;s like my uncle, not blood, but you know. I grew up with his daughters Gargi and Radha. I remember when Sita, his youngest, was born.</i> He might even speak the verboten words: <i>Have you heard of Ranjit Singh, Bapuji&#x2019;s second in command? He&#x2019;s my actual, like, Pa!</i> He should just draw her a cast list complete with family trees.<br><br>&#x2014;Nothing, he says. For me.<br><br>The plane turns east. On screen its tiny replica inches forward, crossing out half the world. He shifts again, trying to keep his shirt from creasing, his suit from getting crumpled. His tie has a stripe that confirms a certain university (Harvard); his shoes are handmade English (Lobbs). These are the spoils he is returning with. After fifteen years. To Delhi, city of his childhood, a diamond inside a diamond on the map.<br><br>***<br><br>The cabin lights fade. The passengers recline, stiff like store dummies, eyes masked against each other. He opens the magazine.<br><br><i>Birthday Greetings</i>, by Barun J. Bharat.<br><br>J.J.J. Maybe, Jivan thinks, Barun&#x2019;s one of those guys who needs that extra initial, like some men need a tie-pin, to make him feel safe. Or maybe he has a more famous brother.<br><br><i>The Age of Devraj</i>, writes Barun. <i>We salute him, founder of The Devraj Company, one of India&#x2019;s most loved tycoons, who has just achieved his Seventy Fifth year.</i><br><br>Devraj. Grinning from a double-page spread, dressed in a safari suit and hat. Up to his knees in the watery, fragile Sunderbans, a tiger cub cradled in his arms. <i>Visionary Businessman, Guru to millions, employer of thousands, head of the hundred-hotel Company, father of three lovely daughters, Gargi, Radha and Sita, the caption says. Adoptive father to Tipu Sultan, a two-year-old tiger cub, who was raised by Devraj Bapuji, Animal Lover and Environmental Hero, in the Company private zoo.</i><br><br>And also&#x2014;also&#x2014;Godfather to one lucky bro called Jeet. How could Barun J. Bharat, in-flight journalist, miss that? What about the textile mills from Punjab to Trivandrum, busy spinning silk into gold? Or the cement and brickworks in some serious backwaters? <i>Huff and puff, said the big, bad wolf, ar�, of course the house won&#x2019;t blow down.</i> Don&#x2019;t forget the transport industry that runs on parts made in Company factories, from steel, mined and smelted in Company concerns&#x2014;Barun needs a lesson in proper research: the kind of deep Googling a person might do if they were banished to a galaxy far, far away, surviving in exile, waiting.<br><br>There is some news. The Company is moving into cars. It will produce, in the name of Devraj&#x2019;s youngest, most precious daughter, Sita, and in recognition of her commitment to many causes, but particularly to Mother Nature, India&#x2019;s first hybrid, the world&#x2019;s smallest vehicle, aimed at the common man. <i>The Company reach is only growing in these times when India,</i> Barun writes, <i>is claiming her rightful place on the global stage. All has been brought into being by Devraj Bapuji&#x2019;s sheer determination, his far-reaching gaze. One of our most venerated business leaders, his spirituality ever feeding his superlative business ethos, his work for the girl-child in education recognised by a special Businesses in Charitable Endeavours Award given to him by the honourable Minister of Human Resource Development and the President of India. A close personal friend of left and right and an adviser on fiscal policy, his skill with a skillet at family barbecues is most appreciated by his friends. He is a man whose fearlessness in business has grown from grassroots to luxury hotels into one of India&#x2019;s leading brands yet he remains humble.</i><br><br>Wow, could Barun use a class in white writing. His prose is cloying like Diwali sweets, clogging the throat. Jalebi language, full of twists and turns, slick with the street oil it&#x2019;s fried in. Yet Jon can taste his longed-for Delhi in the words. Could he speak Barun, if he tried? He has the core skills. Before he was sent to America, his father would task him to take the daily national newspapers, to search and cut and read out loud any coverage that mentioned Devraj, Ranjit or the Company concerns. He was an obedient nine years old: he only told the good stories. In those days it seemed that was all there was: it looks as if nothing has changed.<br><br>He smiles. Who would guess from this report that Devraj used to wear specially dyed, saffron-coloured Y-fronts every day? That some Guru told the old man he would live past a hundred if he did? Those are true facts. Once when he was still called Jivan, and only about ten, he was playing <i>The Bold and the Beautiful </i>with Radha (it was her idea), somewhere they should not have been (Devraj&#x2019;s walk-in closet). In a drawer under the kurta pyjama, the handloom shawls, the ties hanging flaccid from a rack, he saw the stacks of orange underwear for himself. Radha told him what the Guru had said&nbsp;<i>for longevity of body and name: saffron must be worn each day, next to the most precious skin.</i> Was that the first time Radha showed Jivan her own panties? Pink they were, with frills. Then, she cried because he would not show his.<br><br>He skims the pages until a smaller headline stops his eye. <i>Devraj Celebrates as Company forays to Kashmir.</i> This, he did not know. <i>Soon</i>, according to Barun J. Bharat, <i>the discerning tourist will be able to holiday courtesy of the Company in seven-star luxury in the coolest (literally!) new destination for domestic and international travellers, reclaiming the world&#x2019;s most beautiful memory of love. Where the latest iteration of the iconic Company Mukti Spa</i>, the article says, <i>will make you say &#x201c;Ahh.&#x201d;</i><br><br>New car launching, new hotel opening. Domestic tourist market growing in a city ripe for takeover. The whole world in recession except at Devraj Company, Main Street, New India. He sits back, the magazine a baton in his hands.<br><br><i>It&#x2019;s not about land, it&#x2019;s about money.</i><br><br>The article ends with a love letter to Sita. <i>One of Delhi's top young beauties-with-brains: elegant, accomplished, so devoted to Bapuji that since she returned from UK she is at his side for every public engagement. Still single aged 22, she is India's most eligible Bachelorette</i>, writes Barun.<br><br>There is a picture of Devraj in a white kurta pyjama and brown shawl. He is looking down at Sita, her back is to the camera&#x2014;her sari blouse is laced like an old-school corset, pinching her skin to diamonds.

Still single aged 22, she is India&#x2019;s most eligible Bachelorette, writes Barun. In the final shot they are under a banner: <i>Green Delhi Clean Delhi! </i>with the Minister for Tourism, he&#x2019;s having a great trip with his arm around Sita&#x2019;s shoulder. She is holding a hand over her mouth as if yawning or laughing, it&#x2019;s hard to tell which. Jivan examines the picture. There it is, on her third finger&#x2014;Gargi, Radha and Jeet all have a ring like this&#x2014;Devraj&#x2019;s initial twinned with theirs carved out in the flat-faced gold.<br><br>The caption says <i>Devrajji, Sita Devrajkumari. Special VVIP guests at the Annual Convention of Indian Tourism and Heritage dinner function, hosted at The Company Delhi Grand Hotel and Mukti Spa.</i><br><br><i>Mukti again, mukti.</i> Jivan cannot remember what it means. He closes his eyes. <i>Liberation</i>. Sita was tiny when Jivan left. All he remembers is a little princess, attached to her Lottie, who was never allowed to play out. Held in the sky and the world is turning. Perhaps he has always been here, ageing on this plane. Perhaps the last years in America are no more than Disney dreams.<br><br>Outside: nothing. He calls for another whisky.<br><br>&#x2014;Sorry, sir, we only serve unlimited drinks in First Class.<br><br>The flight attendant walks away, her hair so neat, her makeup so pat she could be Company-made, remote-controlled. She sweeps behind the red curtain that divides the rich from the not-so-much. Beyond that curtain is wonderland. Drinks and legroom; stewardesses who never say 'no'.<br><br>The captives of economy surround each other. A tangle of saris, plaits, cardigans, high-heeled sandals slung into empty Dunkin&#x2019; Donuts boxes, torn-up <i>Glamour </i>magazines. The men stretch across the seats, the women clutch the children; the children won&#x2019;t let go of their Nintendo DSis even as they sleep. Dinner is given, not served: brown plastic lumps in a makhani sauce, rice and pickles. Or white plastic lumps with herb sauce instead. He chooses Indian, then Western, cannot stomach anything. Next to him, the newlyweds try to keep food, sachets, cutlery on the tray, to eat without elbowing each other. The smells are of rehydrated flesh, the toilets, feet.<br><br>Jon&#x2019;s face is reflected in the touchscreen. It looks warped, as if he has become his own old man. <i>Ranjit Kumar Singh, the Company&#x2019;s Head of New Business, a taste for bright socks and matching breast-pocket handkerchiefs. Suits bespoke from Heritage, fabrics fresh from Company supplies.</i><br><br>The bride beside him is finishing her food. Her fork breaks; she wipes the plastic tub with her fingers. He shifts to avoid any falling grains of rice.

Believing that "winter is the most encouraging season for the gardener ... the only time of the year when the creative juices of the plantsman are given free reign," Roehm offers expert information on a wide variety of horticultural activities suitable for the season, including forcing bulbs and branches, growing and arranging hardy hellebores, and creating a winter-garden checklist.<p> Not to be outdone are the holidays, namely Christmas, New Year's and Valentine's Day, which Roehm illustrates down to the finest detail. From delectable meals and to-die-for decorations to vibrant floral arrangements and millennial good-luck gifts, everything one needs to plan and execute the finest of gatherings is covered, complete with clear recipes and instructions. Full-color photographs accompany Roehm's musings, along with pockets for storing ideas and "additional notes/inspirations/remember next year" lists for recording personal thoughts, making the <i>Winter Notebook</i> ideal for organizing one of the busiest seasons of the year. <i>--Stefanie Hargreaves</i></p>Carolyne Roehm, noted author and lifestyle contributor to Good Morning America, brings her gardening expertise to viewers weekly as the host of Country Homes, Country Gardens.<p>In 1991, Roehm, who had always taken great pleasure in indulging and surrounding herself with things she loved, decided to turn her personal passion for beauty and comfort into a fulfilling career. A longtime associate (and neighbor) of famed couturier, Oscar de la Renta, Roehm began her own fashion business, setting her designs apart from many others in the industry with her unflagging insistence on only the finest quality materials. Her designs quickly found a home with discriminating consumers, as her first year alone saw revenues exceeding $3 million. But Roehm's passion for beauty extended beyond the world of fashion, and she became determined to broaden her horizons accordingly.</p><p>Following a stint at the famed Paris flower shop, Moulie Savart, Roehm took the knowledge she gained there and put it into practical use for the everyday gardener. Resulting from her considerable experience, she takes great joy in revealing the many secrets she learned to help everyone achieve a bountiful and beautiful garden.</p><p>In 1997, Roehm published her first book, A Passion for Flowers (September 1997, HarperCollins Publishers) in which she detailed the experts' tricks to perfect gardening. A firm believer in luxury for everyone, Roehm feels that luxury doesn't necessarily mean expensive. Her breathtaking floral arrangements, for example, traditionally contain many common flowers such as carnations, marigolds, bleeding hearts, and Queen Anne's lace, which she collects from her own garden at her Connecticut home.</p><p>Roehm applies the fashion lessons she learned to her flowers. The familiar cry of "accessorize" is as important to arranging blooms as it is to one's own appearance. "I can't tell you how often I've seen a dress ruined with the wrong accessories," Roehm explains. "It's the same with flowers. Even the most beautiful flowers don't work if they're in the wrong vase or placed against the wrong background."</p></p><h2>Repetition</h2><p>Set in 1960, this novel tells of Filib Kobal's journey from his home in Carinthia to Slovenia on the trail of his missing brother, Gregor. He is armed only with two of Gregor's books: a copy book from agricultural school, and a Slovenian - German dictionary, in which Gregor has marked certain words. The resulting investigation of the laws of language and naming becomes a transformative investigation of himself and the world around him.<br></p><p>Repetition<br><i>One</i>THE BLIND WINDOWA QUARTER OF A CENTURY, or a day, has passed since I arrived in Jesenice on the trail of my missing brother. I was not yet twenty and I had just taken my final school examination. I ought to have felt free, for after weeks of study the summer months lay open before me. But I had set out with mixed feelings, what with my old father, my ailing mother, and my confused sister at home in Rinkenberg. Besides, after being released from the seminary, I had got used, during the past year, to my class in the state school in Klagenfurt, where girls were in the majority, and now I suddenly found myself alone. While my classmates piled into the bus together and set out for Greece, I played the loner who preferred to go to Yugoslavia by himself. (The truth was that I simply didn't have the money for the group trip.) Another reason for my unease was that I had never been outside of Austria and knew very little Slovene, though it was hardly a foreign language for an inhabitant of a village in southern Carinthia.After a glance at my newly issued Austrian passport, the border guard in Jesenice spoke to me in his language. When I failed to understand, he told me in German that Kobal was a Slavic name, that the word meant the span between parted legs, a "step," and consequently a person standing with legs outspread, so that my name would have been better suited to him,the border guard. The elderly official beside him, in civilian clothes, white-haired, with the round, rimless glasses of a scholar, explained with a smile that the related verb meant "to climb" or "to ride"; thus, my given name, Filip, "lover of horses," fitted in with Kobal, and he felt sure I would someday do honor to my full name. (Since then, I have often found the civil servants of this so-called progressive country, which was once part of an empire, surprisingly well educated.) Suddenly he grew grave, came a step closer, and looked me solemnly in the eye. I should know, he said, that two and a half centuries ago there had been a Slovene hero named Kobal. In the year 1713 Gregor Kobal, from near Tolmin on the headwaters of the river which in Italy farther down was known as the Isonzo, had been one of the leaders of the great Tolmin peasant revolt, and in 1714 he had been executed along with his comrades. It was he who had said--and his words were still renowned in the Republic of Slovenia--that the Emperor was a mere servant and that the people had better take matters into their own hands. Thus informed--of something I already knew--I, with my sea bag over my shoulder, was permitted to step out of the dark frontier station without showing any cash, and to set foot in the north Yugoslavian town, which in those days our school maps still identified by its old Austrian name of Assling (in parentheses), side by side with the Slovene Jesenice.&nbsp;<br>For a long while I stood outside the station, with the Karawanken Mountains, which I had seen in the distance all my life, close at my back. The city begins at the exit from the tunnel and winds down the narrowriver valley, surmounted by a tenuous strip of sky, which broadens to the south and is immediately veiled by the smoke of the iron foundries. Jesenice is a long village with one exceedingly noisy street, the side streets being little more than steep paths. It was a warm evening at the end of June 1960, and the surface of the street gave off a dazzling brightness. It came to me that what made the station so dark were the buses which stopped outside the big swinging door in quick succession and drove on. Strange how soothing the overall grayness--the gray of the houses, the street, the cars, so very different from the bright colors of the cities of Carinthia, "Carinthia the beautiful" according to a nineteenth-century Slovene song--was to my eyes in the evening light. The short Austrian train that had brought me and that would soon go back through the tunnel seemed as clean and bright as a toy train beside the massive, dusty Yugoslavian trains, and the blue uniforms of its crew, who were talking loudly on the platform, provided a dash of exotic color amid the prevailing gray. It also struck me that the swarms of people in the streets of this smallish town, quite unlike the inhabitants of the small towns in my own country, took notice of me now and then but never stared at me. And the longer I stood there, the more certain I became that this was a great country.&nbsp;<br>Now, only a few hours later, how far behind me seemed my afternoon in Villach, where I had visited my history and geography teacher. We had talked about my plans for the fall: Should I do my military service at once, or get a deferment and study? But study what? And then, in one of the parks, the teacher had read me a fairy tale that he himself had written, asked me for myopinion, and listened to it with an expression of total seriousness. He was a bachelor and lived alone with his mother, who, while I was there, kept asking through the closed door whether her son was all right and whether he wanted anything. He had accompanied me to the station and there, as secretively as if he felt someone was watching, he had slipped me a bank note. I was very grateful, but I hadn't been able to show it, and now too, when I tried to visualize the man across the border, all I could see was a wart on his pale forehead. The face that went with it was that of the border guard, who was hardly older than myself and yet, to judge by his bearing, his voice, and the look in his eyes, had evidently found his place in life. Of the teacher, his apartment, and the whole of Villach I had preserved no image apart from two pensioners playing chess at a table and the glitter of the halo over the statue of the Virgin Mary on the main square.Fully present to my mind, however--and still fully present today, twenty-five years later--was the morning of the same day, when I took leave of my father on the wooded hill from which the village of Rinkenberg took its name. With sagging knees, dangling arms, and goutgnarled fingers, which at that moment impersonated furious clenched fists, the frail, aging man, much smaller than I, stood by the wayside Cross and shouted at me: "All right, go to the dogs like your brother, like our whole family! None of us has ever amounted to anything, and you won't either. You won't even get to be a good gambler like me." Yet, just then, he had embraced me for the first time in my life, and I had looked over his shoulder at the dewy wetness on the bottom of his trousers, with the feeling that in me he was actuallyembracing himself. But then in memory my father's embrace held me, not only that evening outside the Jesenice station, but down through the years, and I heard his curse as a blessing. In reality he had been deadly serious, but in my thoughts I saw him grinning. May his embrace carry me through this story.&nbsp;<br>Standing in the twilight, in the roar of the through traffic, which seemed positively soothing, I reflected that up until then I had never felt held in a woman's embrace. I had no girlfriend. When the one girl whom I knew, so to speak, embraced me, her embrace struck me as mischievous or defiant. Yet how proud I was when we walked down the street together, keeping our distance, but obviously belonging to each other in the eyes of the people coming in the opposite direction. Once somebody called from a group of strolling little-more-than-children : "Have <i>you</i> got a beautiful girl!" And another time an old woman stopped, looked from the girl to me, and said literally: "Lucky fellow!" Such moments seemed a fulfillment of longing. And then the joy, in the changing light of the movie house, of seeing the shimmering profile beside me, the mouth, the cheek, the eye. The ultimate was the sense of bodily closeness, which sometimes came unsought; even a purely accidental contact would have seemed an infringement. So perhaps I had a girlfriend after all. For to me the thought of a woman meant, not desire or lust, but the wishful image of a beautiful companion--yes, my companion would have to be beautiful!--whom I would at last be able to tell ... Tell what? Just tell. At the age of twenty I conceived falling-into-one-another's-arms, loving, being fond of one another, as a constant, forbearingyet unreserved, calm yet exclamatory, clarifying and illuminating telling, and in that connection I thought of my mother, who, whenever I had been out of the house for any length of time, in town or alone in the woods or out in the fields, assailed me with her "Tell me." Despite frequent rehearsals, I had never, at least before her illness, succeeded in telling her anything. As a rule, I could only tell unasked--though, once launched, I needed the right questions to keep me going.And now, outside the station, I discovered that since my arrival in Jesenice I had been silently telling my girlfriend about my day. And what was I telling her? Neither incidents nor events, but mere impressions, a sight, a sound, a smell. The jet of the little fountain across the street, the red of the newspaper kiosk, the exhaust fumes of the heavy trucks--once I told her about them, they ceased to exist in themselves and merged with one another. And the teller was not I, it was the experience itself. This silent telling deep inside me was something greater than myself. And, without growing older, the girl to whom it was addressed was transformed into a young woman, just as the boy of twenty, in growing aware of the teller inside him, became an ageless adult. We stood facing each other, exactly at eye level. This eye level was the measure of the telling. I sensed the tenderest of strengths within me. And it said to me: "Jump!"A star appeared, a constellation in itself, in the yellowish factory sky over Jesenice, and a glowworm flew through the smoke of the street down below. Two railroad cars bumped together. In the supermarket, the checkout girls were relieved by cleaning women. At a window in a high-rise building, a man stood smoking in his undershirt.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>Exhausted as after strenuous exercise, I sat in the station restaurant until almost midnight, over a bottle of the dark, sweet drink which at that time substituted for Coca-Cola in Yugoslavia. Yet I was wide awake, quite otherwise than in the evening at home--whether in the village, at the seminary, or in the city--when I was always too tired to be good company. At the only dance I was taken to, I fell asleep with my eyes open, and in the last hours of the year my father tried in vain to keep me from my bed by playing cards with me. I think that what kept me awake was not so much the strange country as being in a restaurant; in a waiting room, most likely I would soon have felt tired.I was sitting in one of the brown wooden booths, rather like a choir stall. In front of me, the bright tiers of station platforms, and behind me, the equally bright highway with its illuminated apartment houses. Behind me, full buses were still running this way and that; in front of me, full trains. Of the travelers, I saw no faces, only silhouettes; but I saw the silhouettes through a face reflected in plate glass--my own. With the help of this reflection, which did not portray me as an individual but showed only a forehead, eye sockets, and lips, I was able to dream the silhouettes not only of the passengers but also of the apartment-house dwellers as they moved through their rooms or, occasionally, sat on the balconies. It was an airy, luminous, sharp dream in which I had friendly thoughts about all the dark figures. None of them was evil. The old people were old, the couples were couples, the families were families, the children were children, the lonely were lonely, the dogs and cats were dogs and cats, each individual was part of a whole, and I with my reflection belonged to this nation, whichI envisaged on an unceasing, peaceful, adventurous, serene journey through the night, a journey in which the sleeping, the sick, the dying, even the dead were included. I sat up straight to get a better view of my dream. The one thing that troubled me was the larger-than-life portrait of the President, hanging in the exact center of the room, over the bar. Marshal Tito was unmistakably there in his heavily braided uniform with all its decorations. Leaning forward over a table on which his clenched fist rested, he looked down at me with bright, fixed eyes. I could almost hear him say: "I know you," and I wanted to answer: "But I don't know myself."&nbsp;<br>My dream went no further until the waitress appeared in the dingy light behind the bar; in her shadowy face, nothing was distinct but her eyelids, which almost hid her eyes even when she was looking straight ahead. Suddenly, while contemplating those eyelids, I saw my mother, ghostlike but very real. She put the glasses in the sink, skewered a receipt on a spike, ran a cloth over the brass. Nameless horror when for a moment her eyes, mocking, impenetrable, met mine; horror that was more like a jolt, a shift into a larger dream. In this dream the sick woman had recovered. Thoroughly alive, she bustled, disguised as a waitress, from room to room of the restaurant. Her heels peered out of her slingback shoes. What sturdy legs my mother had now, what swinging hips, what a tower of hair. And though, unlike most of the women in the village, she knew only a few words of Slovene, here, in conversation with an invisible group of men in a neighboring booth, she spoke it with ease and self-assurance. So she wasn't the foundling,the fugitive, the German, the foreigner she had always pretended to be. For a moment, I felt ashamed that this person with the brisk movements, the singsong speech, the loud laugh, the quick furtive glances, should be my mother, and then, through this strange woman, I saw her as precisely as never before. Yes, until recently, my mother had spoken in such a singsong, and whenever she had actually started to sing, her son had wanted to stop his ears. In any choir, however large, I could instantly pick out my mother's voice: a quavering, a trembling, a fervid outpouring, which totally captivated the singer, but not the listener. And her laughter had been not only loud but positively wild, a scream, an outburst of joy, of anger, of bitterness, of contempt, of condemnation. When she cried out with pain at the beginning of her illness, her screams had still sounded like the surprised, half-amused, half-indignant laughter which she tried, more and more feebly as time went on, to cover up by singing trills. I conjured up the various voices in our household and heard my father swearing, my sister giggling and weeping in the course of muttered conversations with herself, and my mother laughing from end to end of the village--and Rinkenberg is a long village. (I saw myself as mute.) Then I realized that my mother was not merely self-assured like the waitress but positively imperious. She had always wanted to run a big hotel, with the staff as her subjects. Our farm was small and her demands were great. In her stories about my brother, he was always represented as a king cheated out of his throne.And she saw me as the rightful heir to the throne yet doubted from the start that I would ever reign. Sometimes, in looking at me, her face froze into anexpression of pity without a glimmer of compassion. I had often been characterized by someone--a priest, a teacher, a girl, a classmate; but in that silent look of my mother's I felt not only characterized but seen through and condemned. And I am sure that it wasn't after a certain lapse of time, for any specific reason, that she started looking at me like that, but that she had done...Text: English, German (translation)</p><h2>Exploring Modern Art (Come Look With Me)</h2><p>COME LOOK WITH ME: EXPLORING MODERN ART introduces children to twelve magnificent works of art.

I don&#x2019;t know how many times my mother has used this praising aphorism during the ten years I&#x2019;ve been on this earth. I also feel as though I&#x2019;ve heard versions of First Brother&#x2019;s dream many times. A poor farmer carries freshly picked turnips to the market town to barter for salt. He takes a misstep and tumbles down a cliff. This could have ended in a &#x201c;terrible death&#x201d; far from home&#x2014;the worst thing that can happen to an Akha person&#x2014;but instead he lands in the camp of a wealthy salt seller. The salt seller brews tea, the two men start talking, and&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. The coincidence could have been anything: the salt seller will now marry the farmer&#x2019;s daughter or the farmer&#x2019;s fall protected him from being washed away in a flood. This time, the farmer was able to trade with the salt seller without having to walk all the way to the market town.<br> <br>It was a good dream with no bad omens, which pleases everyone seated on the floor around the fire pit. As A-ma said, every story, every dream, every waking minute of our lives is filled with one fateful coincidence after another. People and animals and leaves and fire and rain&#x2014;we whirl around each other like handfuls of dried rice kernels being tossed into the sky. A single kernel cannot change its direction. It cannot choose to fly to the right or to the left nor can it choose where it lands&#x2014;balanced on a rock, and therefore salvageable, or bouncing off that same rock into the mud, becoming instantly useless and valueless. Where they alight is fate, and nothing&#x2014;no thing anyway&#x2014;can change their destinies.<br> <br>Second Brother is next in line to tell his dream. It is ordinary. Third Brother recites his dream, which is worse than dull.<br> <br>A-ba nudges me with his elbow. &#x201c;Girl, tell us a dream you had last night.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;My dream?&#x201d; The request surprises me, because neither of my parents has asked this of me before. I&#x2019;m just a girl. Unimportant, as I&#x2019;ve been told many times. Why A-ba has chosen this day to single me out, I don&#x2019;t know, but I hope to be worthy of the attention. &#x201c;I was walking back to the village after picking tea. It was already dark. I could see smoke rising from household fires. The smell of the food should have made me hungry.&#x201d; (I&#x2019;m always hungry.) &#x201c;But my stomach, eyes, arms, and legs were all happy to know I was where I was supposed to be. Our ancestral home.&#x201d; I watch my family&#x2019;s faces. I want to be honest, but I can&#x2019;t alarm anyone with the truth.<br> <br>&#x201c;What else did you see?&#x201d; A-ma asks. In our village, power and importance go in this order: the headman; the ruma&#x2014;the spirit priest&#x2014;who keeps harmony between spirits and humans; and the nima&#x2014;the shaman&#x2014;who has the ability to go into a trance, visit the trees God planted in the spirit world to represent each soul on earth, and then determine which incantations can be used to heal or enhance vitality. These men are followed next by all grandfathers, fathers, and males of any age. My mother is ranked first among women not only in our village but on the entire mountain. She is a midwife and so much more, treating men, women, and children as they pass through their lives. She&#x2019;s also known for her ability to interpret dreams. The silver balls that decorate her headdress tremble, catching the firelight, as she waits for my response. The others bend their heads over their bowls, nervous for me.<br> <br>I force myself to speak. &#x201c;I dreamed of a dog.&#x201d;<br> <br>Everyone prickles at this revelation.<br> <br>&#x201c;We allow dogs to live among us for three reasons,&#x201d; A-ma says reassuringly, trying to settle the family. &#x201c;They are essential for sacrifices, they alert us to bad omens, and they are good to eat. What kind was yours?&#x201d;<br> <br>I hesitate once again. The dog in my dream stood on our roof, alert, his snout pointed upward, his tail erect. To me, he looked as though he were guarding our village, and seeing him made me feel confident that I would make it home safely. But the Akha people believe&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.<br> <br>A-ma gives me a stern look. &#x201c;Dogs are not human, but they live in the human world. They are not of the spirit world, but they have the gift of seeing spirits. When you hear a dog howl or bark in the night, you know he has spotted a spirit and hopefully scared him away. Now answer me, Girl,&#x201d; she says, pushing her silver bracelets up her wrist. &#x201c;What kind was yours?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;The whole family was sitting outside when the dog began to bark,&#x201d; I say, when I know perfectly well that dreaming of a dog on the roof means that he hasn&#x2019;t done his job and that a spirit has sneaked past the protection of the village&#x2019;s spirit gate and is now roaming among us. &#x201c;He frightened off an evil spirit. A-poe-mi-yeh rewarded him by giving everyone in our family a chicken to eat&#x2014;&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Our supreme god gave every man and woman his or her own chicken?&#x201d; First Brother scoffs.<br> <br>&#x201c;And all the children too! Every single person had a whole chicken&#x2014;&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;That&#x2019;s impossible! Meaningless! A fabrication!&#x201d; First Brother looks at A-ba indignantly. &#x201c;Make her stop&#x2014;&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;So far I like her dream,&#x201d; A-ba says. &#x201c;Go on, Girl.&#x201d;<br> <br>The more pressure I feel to continue my story, the easier it becomes to lie. &#x201c;I saw birds in a nest. The babies had just broken through their shells. The a-ma bird tapped each one gently with her beak. Tap, tap, tap.&#x201d;<br> <br>A moment passes as my parents and brothers ponder this addition. As A-ma searches my face, I try to keep my expression as still as a bowl of soy milk left out overnight. Finally, she nods approvingly.<br> <br>&#x201c;Counting her babies. New lives. A protecting mother.&#x201d; She smiles. &#x201c;All is good.&#x201d;<br> <br>A-ba stands up, signaling that breakfast is done. I&#x2019;m not sure what&#x2019;s more troublesome&#x2014;that A-ma can&#x2019;t see everything inside my head as I always thought she could or that I&#x2019;ve gotten away with my fabrications. I feel pretty terrible until I remind myself that I prevented my family from the worry my dream would have caused them. I lift my bowl to my lips and slurp down the last of my broth. A few bitter mountain leaves slip into my mouth along with the fiery liquid. Chili flakes burn their way to my stomach. For as long as that heat lasts, I&#x2019;ll feel full.<br> <br>When we leave the house, stars still glitter above our heads. I carry a small basket on my back. My other family members have large baskets slung over their shoulders. Together we walk along the dirt lane that divides Spring Well Village, which has about forty households and nestles in one of the many saddles on Nannuo Mountain. Most of the homes are sheltered by old tea trees. The tea terraces and gardens where we work, however, are outside the village.<br> <br>We join our neighbors, who live four houses away from us. The youngest daughter, Ci-teh, is my age. I could find my friend anywhere, because her cap is the most decorated of any girl&#x2019;s in Spring Well. In addition to tea, her family grows pumpkins, cabbages, sugarcane, and cotton. They also cultivate opium, which they sell to the spirit priest to use in ceremonies and to A-ma to use as a medicine for those suffering from the agony of broken bones, the torment of the wasting disease, or the mental anguish that comes from losing a loved one. The extra money Ci-teh&#x2019;s family earns means they can sacrifice more and larger animals for offerings, which in turn means that the customary shared cuts of meat that are given to everyone in the village are more and larger too. Ci-teh&#x2019;s family&#x2019;s wealth also means that her cap is decorated with lots of silver charms. Apart from these differences, Ci-teh and I are like sisters&#x2014;maybe closer than sisters, because we spend so much time side by side.<br> <br>As we continue toward our work, we leave the last house behind and proceed a little farther until we reach the spirit gate. Carved figures of a woman and a man are mounted on the posts. The woman has huge breasts. The man has a penis that is as thick as timber bamboo, longer than my entire height, and sticking straight out. Whittled birds of prey and vicious dogs hang from the crossbeam. Be warned. If someone doesn&#x2019;t pass through the gate properly&#x2014;touching it perhaps&#x2014;then something terrible can happen, like a death. We must all be mindful of the gate.<br> <br>We begin to climb. Ci-teh and I chatter, catching up as though many weeks have passed instead of one night.<br> <br>&#x201c;I worked on my embroidery before bed,&#x201d; Ci-teh confides.<br> <br>&#x201c;I fell asleep before my a-ba had his pipe,&#x201d; I tell her.<br> <br>&#x201c;Hot water or tea with breakfast?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Tea.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Dreams?&#x201d;<br> <br>I don&#x2019;t want to tell her any of that. We have a long way to go and the only other way to make the time pass quickly is through games and challenges.<br> <br>&#x201c;How many different parasites can you spot on the trees before we get to that boulder?&#x201d; I hoot.<br> <br>Nine, and I win.<br> <br>&#x201c;How are you doing with your weaving?&#x201d; Ci-teh asks, knowing I haven&#x2019;t shown a talent for it.<br> <br>&#x201c;So boring!&#x201d; I holler, and the men look back at me disapprovingly. &#x201c;Let&#x2019;s see how many jumps it will take from this rock to that one way up there.&#x201d;<br> <br>Seven, and I win again.<br> <br>&#x201c;Last night, Deh-ja&#x201d;&#x2014;that would be Ci-teh&#x2019;s sister-in-law&#x2014;&#x201c;said she wants to have a son.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;There&#x2019;s nothing new with that one.&#x201d; I point to a little rise. &#x201c;Bet I can beat you to the top.&#x201d;<br> <br>My feet know this route well, and I hop from rock to rock and jump over exposed roots. In places, the dirt is powdery between my toes. In other spots, pebbles poke at the soft underparts of my arches. Since it&#x2019;s still dark, I sense more than see the old tea, camphor, ginkgo, and cassia trees, as well as stands of bamboo, towering around me.<br> <br>I win again, which nettles Ci-teh. But that happens between sisters too. Ci-teh and I are close, but we compete against each other&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. constantly. I won our games today; she reminded me she&#x2019;s better at embroidery and weaving. Our teacher says I could prove I&#x2019;m smart if I worked a little harder; he would never say that about Ci-teh.<br> <br>&#x201c;See you at the tea collection center,&#x201d; I say when Ci-teh follows her a-ma onto another path. I linger&#x2014;watching them scramble up a steep stretch of mountain, their empty baskets bouncing on their backs&#x2014;and then I skip ahead to catch up to A-ma.<br> <br>After a half hour of walking, the black of night begins to fade and the sky turns pale. Clouds catch tints of pink and lavender. Then everything brightens when the sun crests the mountain. The cicadas waken and begin to trill. And still we climb. My a-ba and brothers maintain distance ahead of us so they can have their man talk. A-ma is as strong as any man, but she takes her time, looking about for herbs and mushrooms she can use in her potions. First Sister-in-law has stayed home with the children too young to pick tea and too big to be carried by their mothers, but my second and third sisters-in-law accompany us with their babies tied to their bosoms as they too forage, searching the moist forest floor for anything we might take home to put in our dinner soup.<br> <br>We reach First Brother&#x2019;s tea terraces at last. I move slowly between the tightly packed rows of bushes, scanning the outermost branches for the bud and two, maybe three, leaves that begin to unfurl as the sun&#x2019;s rays warm them. I gently nip the tiny cluster between my thumbnail and the side of my forefinger above the first joint. My thumbnail is stained and the little pad of flesh callused. I&#x2019;m already marked as a tea picker.<br> <br>After two hours, A-ma comes to me. She runs her hands through my leaves, fluffing and inspecting them. &#x201c;You&#x2019;re very good, Girl, at finding the choicest bud sets. Maybe too good.&#x201d; She glances in A-ba&#x2019;s direction a few terraces away, then leans down and whispers, &#x201c;Pick a little faster. And you can take some of the older and tougher leaves. We need more leaves, not just ideal bud sets, from each bush.&#x201d;<br> <br>I understand. More leaves means more money to be paid by the tea collection center. When my basket is full, I find First Brother, who transfers my pickings into a burlap sack, and the process begins again. We break for a lunch of rice balls rolled in dried moss, and then pick all through the afternoon. I stay close to my mother, who sings to keep us in the rhythm of picking and to remove our minds from the heat and humidity. Finally, A-ba calls, &#x201c;Enough.&#x201d; We gather at the spot where First Brother has been consolidating our harvest. The last leaves are packed into burlap sacks. Then each sack is strung with ropes and a flat board. A-ma mounts the smallest one on my back, wraps the ropes over my shoulders, and secures the board on my forehead. All this is to help us carry the weight evenly, but the pull of the ropes on my shoulders and the press of the wood against my forehead are instantly painful.<br> <br>Once the others have their sacks on their backs and our picking baskets have been bound together for us to retrieve on our way home, we begin the two-hour journey to the tea collection center. We&#x2019;re all aware we must hurry, but our pace can only be slow. One sure foot after another sure foot. We climb up and over more tea terraces, each one seemingly steeper than the last. And then we&#x2019;re back in the forest, which has engulfed forsaken tea tree groves and gardens. Vines wrap around the trunks, which have become homes to orchids, mushrooms, and parasites like crab&#x2019;s claw. How old are the trees? Five hundred years old? A thousand years old? I don&#x2019;t know the answers. What I do know is that selling leaves from them was abandoned long ago. Only families like ours use the leaves from trees like these for at-home drinking.<br> <br>By the time we reach the tea collection center, I&#x2019;m so tired I want to cry. We enter through big gates into a courtyard. My vision flits around the open space, looking for Ci-teh&#x2019;s distinctive cap. We Akha have our own style of dress. So too do the Dai, Lahu, Bulang, and the other tribes who live here with us. Everyone wears their work clothes, but every headdress, scarf, and cap is decorated, according to the traditions of that clan and the individual taste and style of each woman or girl. I don&#x2019;t spot Ci-teh. Her family must have come and gone already. They might even be home by now, eating their supper.<br> <br>My stomach calls to me, aggravated yet entranced by the smells coming from the food vendor stalls. The perfume of skewered meat on an open flame fills my head. My mouth waters. One day I&#x2019;ll get to taste one of those. Maybe. Occasionally, we treat ourselves to scallion pancakes that an old Dai woman sells from a cart just to the left, inside the tea collection center courtyard. The aroma is enticing&#x2014;not as rich as the grilled meat but cleanly fragrant with the smell of fresh eggs.<br> <br>A-ma, my sisters-in-law, and I squat in the dirt as my a-ba and brothers take our bags through a set of double doors that lead to the weighing area. On the other side of the courtyard, I spot a boy about my age, lingering by a mountain of burlap bags filled with tea waiting to be transported to the big city of Menghai, where it&#x2019;ll be processed in a government-run factory. His hair is as black as my own. He too is barefoot. I don&#x2019;t recognize him from school. But I&#x2019;m less interested in him as a person than I am in the steaming scallion pancake he holds in his tea-stained fingers. He looks around to make sure no one is watching&#x2014;obviously missing me&#x2014;before ducking out of sight behind the burlap mound. I get up, cross the courtyard, and peek around the corner of the wall of tea.<br> <br>&#x201c;What are you doing back there?&#x201d; I ask.<br> <br>...</p><h2>A Thielicke Trilogy</h2><p>Three Books in One: * Between God and Satan; * The Silence of God; * Out of the Depths.</p><p></p><h2>The History of Winchester Firearms 1866-1992</h2><p>This classic-revised and completely updated through 1992- is the standard reference for all collectors and other seeking the facts about any Winchester firearm, old or new.

Among his many novels are <b>On the Road</b>, <b>The Dharma Bums</b>, <b>Big Sur</b>, and <b>Visions of Cody</b>.<br>Ann Charters is the editor of <b>The Portable Sixties Reader</b>, <b>The Portable Jack Kerouac</b>, two volumes of Jack Kerouac's <b>Selected Letters</b>, and <b>Beat Down to Your Soul</b>. She teaches at the University of Connecticut.The peripatetic urgency, Buddhist catchphrases and casual prose of On the Road (1957) and Dharma Bums (1958) made Jack Kerouac (1922-1969) the star of the Beat generation. Kerouac's "craft of spontaneous prose" (in Charters's words) let him use his letters as rough drafts for some of his autobiographical fiction. Devotees of those novels can troll for their favorite episodes among Kerouac's complaints, requests, loans, repayments, reports, retorts, rebukes and resolutions. "[W]hen I write a book it's just a chapter in the whole story," a 1960 missive to Neal Cassady explains, "but there wd be no literature in the world safe to say i would rather read than my own remembrance of things." Editor Charters (also Kerouac's biographer) uses her annotations and commentary to make the sometimes hasty, expressive missives cohere as an account of the novelist's life. A first volume of letters appeared in 1995; this second starts with the publication of On the Road and continues almost to the day Kerouac died. The years 1957-1960, the height of Kerouac's career, occupy more than half the volume. Later letters record his struggle to care for his ailing mother, his efforts to finish his later books and his troubles with money and health: "I drink more than ever, my hands tremble, I can't type." Frequent addressees and subjects include Gary Snyder, Philip Whalen, Lawrence Ferlinghetti, William Burroughs and Allen Ginsberg ("I still think he's a false prophet, sheep's clothing and ravening wolf"). By turns witty, slovenly and empathetic, the letters provide a look into Kerouac's psyche and into the exhilarating, frustrating, ramshackle milieu he helped create.

Music, Music, Music. Boys, Boys, Boys.</h2><p>This is Sunday Times Music Book of the Year. It is Rough Trade Book of the Year. It is also the Mojo Book of the Year. In 1975, Viv Albertine was obsessed with music but it never occurred to her she could be in a band as she couldn&#39;t play an instrument and she&#39;d never seen a girl play electric guitar. A year later, she was the guitarist in the hugely influential all-girl band the Slits, who fearlessly took on the male-dominated music scene and became part of a movement that changed music. A raw, thrilling story of life on the frontiers and a candid account of Viv&#39;s life post-punk - taking in a career in film, the pain of IVF, illness and divorce and the triumph of making music again - Clothes Music Boys is a remarkable memoir.</p><p><p><strong>An Amazon Best Book of the Month, December 2014:</strong> Viv Albertine's memoir is a book is divided almost straight down the middle. Side One is the story of her upbringing in the north London suburb of Muswell Hill: It's the mid-seventies, and the Sex Pistols are at the head of a massive, angry (or at least frustrated) cultural insurgence. Her rebellious tendencies have led her into the center of punk culture, and inspired by its outsized personalities and confrontational style, she picks up a guitar, forsaking traditional training for the DIY ethos of the day. After her band with the pre-Pistols Sid Vicious (The Flowers of Romance--a possibly sardonic suggestion from Johnny Rotten) fails to launch, Albertine joins forces with The Slits, a ska-infused, all-girl outfit that, through the force of its collective will and audacity, elbows its way to the front of a stage filled with sharp, mostly male elbows. Everyone is wearing Vivenne Westwood's provocative clothing purchased from Malcolm McLaren's infamous boutique, SEX--at least as much as they could afford. Mick Jones of The Clash wanders in and out of the story, first as a gangly proto-punk spending all of his time and loose change trying to put together a band, and later as Albertine's on-again, off-again boyfriend (the classic London Calling track "Train in Vain" was inspired by her). It's a story in the best rock &amp; roll tradition: Initiative leads. Ability chases. Success looms. Then someone bumps the turntable. </p> <p>Side Two. The band has blown apart. Grownup problems ensue: education and career; marriage and kids; serious illness, divorce, and identity. The actor Vincent Gallo. Albertine moves through all of it, drawing from the same well of determination that compelled her to pick up the guitar for the first time. The two sides of the book may tell very different stories, but they share perspective and style that are both straightforward and ultimately uncompromising. If you love this music (and your library contains titles like <i>Please Kill Me</i> and Richard Hell's <i>I Dreamed I Was a Very Clean Tramp</i>), then this book is fascinating and essential. If not, it's fascinating and inspiring. It's occasionally coarse, and often terribly funny and fun.-- <i>Jon Foro</i></p>Songwriter and musician Viv Albertine was the guitarist in the hugely influential female punk band The Slits. A confidante of the Sex Pistols and the Clash, Viv was a key player in British punk culture. Alongside The Slits, she collaborated with numerous musicians, including Adrian Sherwood, before marking out a career in television and film production. After a hiatus of twenty-five years, Viv&#39;s first solo album, The Vermillion Border, was released in 2012 to great critical acclaim.</p><h2>Rough Riders Illustrated Edition</h2><p>In The Rough Riders, Theodore Roosevelt provides a thrilling, first-hand account of the battles fought by his volunteer cavalry regiment during the 1898 Cuban campaign of the Spanish-American War. From the grueling jungle fighting to the regiment&#39;s famous uphill charge at the Battle of San Juan Hill, Roosevelt tells an exciting story of bravery and hardship that is also a first-rate military history. This beautifully illustrated gift dition also includes dozens of rare period photos, maps, and paintings-some of the art created by the very men who served in the Rough Riders.</p><p></p><h2>Empire</h2><p>A great combination of Sci-Fi, Fantasy and Sociology as only Piper could do it in this entertaining story.</p><p></p><h2>The Christmas Doll</h2><p>Set in England in the nineteenth century, two orphaned sisters face an uncertain future after escaping the harsh environment of the workhouse, yet after an encounter with a generous young girl, the sisters are suddenly led down a path that will forever alter their lives in a positive way.</p><p><p><strong>Elvira Woodruff </strong>is the author of many popular novels.

It reveals, for example, when necrophilia is acceptable and who should commit bestiality with whom. It discloses the best time to have a sex change, how to have a virgin birth, and when to eat your lover. It also advises on more mundane matters -- such as male pregnancy and the joys of a detachable penis.<br><br>Entertaining, funny, and marvelously illuminating, the book comprises letters from all creatures worried about their bizarre sex lives to the wise Dr. Tatiana, the only sex columnist in creation with a prodigious knowledge of evolutionary biology. Fusing natural history with advice to the lovelorn, blending wit and rigor, she is able to reassure her anxious correspondents that although the acts they describe might sound appalling and unnatural, they are all perfectly normal -- so long as you are not a human. In the process, she explains the science behind it all, from Darwin's theory of sexual selection to why sexual reproduction exists at all. Applying human standards to the natural world, in the end she reveals the wonders of both.<br></p><p>Finally, a how-to guide, in the guise of a Q&amp;A advice column, for marching, flying, or slithering into the battle of the sexes, whatever your species. In this entertaining and informative book, evolutionary biologist Olivia Judson presents "letters" from sexually frustrated animals, birds, and insects who ask "Dr. Tatiana" to explain some sexual oddity. For example, "Don't Wanna Be Butch in Botswana" writes, "I'm a spotted hyena, a girl. The only trouble is, I've got a large phallus. I can't help feeling that this is unladylike. What's wrong with me?" Each question leads Dr. T. into a fascinating explanation about the sex life of this species, sprinkled with sprightly stories about other species with similar attributes or behavior.<p>You'll learn why one stick-insect copulation lasts for 10 weeks (to prevent other males from gaining access to the fertile female) and why the black-winged damselfly's penis has bristles (to scrape out his rival's sperm). You'll learn that male and female orangutans masturbate with sex toys fashioned from leaves and twigs, that slugs are hermaphrodites with penises on their heads, and that females in more than 80 species eat their lovers before, during, or after sex. You'll also ponder human sexuality when you learn that "monogamy is one of the most deviant behaviors in biology" (although jackdaws, chinstrap penguins, California mice, and some termites swear by it) and "natural selection, it seems, often smiles on strumpets."</p><p>Highly recommended--you'll read this through just for the fun of it and have plenty of odd facts with which to dazzle your dinner companions. <i>--Joan Price</i></p>An alumna of Stanford with a doctorate from Oxford, Olivia Judson is an evolutionary biologist and award-winning journalist who has published in <i>The Economist</i>, <i>Nature</i>, <i>Science,</i> and <i>The Times Higher Education Supplement</i>.

Lewis sets out to persuade his audience of the importance and relevance of universal values such as courage and honor in contemporary society.</p></p><p>C.S. Lewis's <i>The Abolition of Man</i> purports to be a book specifically about public education, but its central concerns are broadly political, religious, and philosophical. In the best of the book's three essays, "Men Without Chests," Lewis trains his laser-sharp wit on a mid- century English high school text, considering the ramifications of teaching British students to believe in idle relativism, and to reject "the doctrine of objective value, the belief that certain attitudes are really true, and others really false, to the kind of thing the universe is and the kinds of things we are." Lewis calls this doctrine the "Tao," and he spends much of the book explaining why society needs a sense of objective values. <i>The Abolition of Man</i> speaks with astonishing freshness to contemporary debates about morality; and even if Lewis seems a bit too cranky and privileged for his arguments to be swallowed whole, at least his articulation of values seems less ego-driven, and therefore is more useful, than that of current writers such as Bill Bennett and James Dobson. <i>--Michael Joseph Gross</i>In this graceful work, C. S. Lewis reflects on society and nature and the challenges of how best to educate our children. He eloquently argues that we need as a society to underpin reading and writing with lessons on morality and in the process both educate and re-educate ourselves. In the words of Walter Hooper, &#34;If someone were to come to me and say that, with the exception of the Bible, everyone on earth was going to be required to read one and the same book, and then ask what it should be, I would with no hesitation say The Abolition of Man. It is the most perfectly reasoned defense of Natural Law (Morality) I have ever seen, or believe to exist. If any book is able to save us from future excesses of folly and evil, it is this book.&#34; This beautiful paperback edition is sure to attract new readers to this classic book.</p><h2>Bud, Not Buddy</h2><p>It's 1936, in Flint, Michigan, and when 10-year-old Bud decides to hit the road to find his father, nothing can stop him.

Franks's field notes, printed in longhand, bring us a trove of facts illustrated by watercolor portraits and landscapes and black-and-white drawings. She goes nosing into early-blooming cottsfoot (yellow flowers "at the top of strong, scaly stems"), remarks on moles (who "carry their tails very upright--the small whiskers on the tail are very sensitive" and each day consume half their body weight); scopes out the common lizard; and listens to the wren ("surely the noisiest bird in the Undercliff, even if it is one of the smallest"). By inviting us to share such good company, British artist Franks brings a rich natural habitat home even to the urbanite. <br>Copyright 1989 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Siddur Lev Shalem for Shabbat &amp; Festivals</h2><p>Siddur Lev Shalem for Shabbat and Festivals features a four column format, new translations in contemporary language, a commentary providing historical context as well as kavanot, poetry and prose that expand and enrich our relationship to the text.&#34;It stretches us in two directions: it is both more traditional and more contemporary than any previous Conservative mahzor.&#34;Siddur Lev Shalem stretches us in that same way: we&#39;ve looked at each service, thinking through how it was put together, how the tradition around it developed, what customs were dropped that can be reincorporated, and what contemporary ideas can respond to the text. A Prayerbook for Home and Synagogue Siddur Lev Shalem is designed for use by individuals as well as for congregations, in the home and in the synagogue. The siddur begins with home preparation for Shabbat -- including meditations on candle lighting, a song that incorporates halakhic instruction, a passage about the neshamah y&#39;teirah (additional spirit) of Shabbat, an introduction to Shabbat from the Zohar, and much more. In the tradition of Mahzor Lev Shalem, the siddur includes an extraordinary array of sources and commentary -- historical, halakhic, and spiritual. While the siddur includes all the traditional prayers, psalms, and songs that are familiar from previous Conservative siddurim, it serves also as an anthology, offering a wide array of readings that can be used to celebrate Shabbat as well as material for study about Shabbat: poems both ancient and modern, Hasidic wisdom, rabbinic midrashim, and commentary on the history and diversity of the liturgy. Today, as in the medieval synagogue, each community and individual can choose from the variety of texts offered, adding our own voices to the harmonious and lavishly textured &#34;Song of Shabbat.&#34; A Prayerbook for All Conservative Jews A Prayerbook for Anyone Attending a Synagogue Service Hardcover Shabbat and Festivals</p><p></p><h2>How to Break a Terrorist: The U.S. Interrogators Who Used Brains, Not Brutality, to Take Down the Deadliest Man in Iraq</h2><p>Finding Abu Musab al Zarqawi, the leader of Al Qaeda in Iraq, had long been the U.S. military's top priority -- trumping even the search for Osama bin Laden. No brutality was spared in trying to squeeze intelligence from Zarqawi's suspected associates. But these "force on force" techniques yielded exactly nothing, and, in the wake of the Abu Ghraib scandal, the military rushed a new breed of interrogator to Iraq. <br> <br> Matthew Alexander, a former criminal investigator and head of a handpicked interrogation team, gives us the first inside look at the U.S. military's attempt at more civilized interrogation techniques -- and their astounding success. The intelligence coup that enabled the June 7, 2006, air strike onZarqawi's rural safe house was the result of several keenly strategized interrogations, none of which involved torture or even "control" tactics. <br> <br> Matthew and his team decided instead to get to know their opponents. Who were these monsters? Who were they working for? What were they trying to protect? Every day the "'gators" matched wits with a rogues' gallery of suspects brought in by Special Forces ("door kickers"): egomaniacs, bloodthirsty adolescents, opportunistic stereo repairmen, Sunni clerics horrified by the sectarian bloodbath, Al Qaeda fanatics, and good people in the wrong place at the wrong time. With most prisoners, negotiation was possible and psychological manipulation stunningly effective. But Matthew's commitment to cracking the case with these methods sometimes isolated his superiors and put his own career at risk. <br> <br> This account is an unputdownable thriller -- more of a psychological suspense story than a war memoir. And indeed, the story reaches far past the current conflict in Iraq with a reminder that we don't have to become our enemy to defeat him. Matthew Alexander and his ilk, subtle enough and flexible enough to adapt to the challenges of modern, asymmetrical warfare, have proved to be our best weapons against terrorists all over the world.</p><p>In the wake of the torture scandal at Abu Ghraib, the U.S. military overhauled its approach to interrogation. How to Break a Terrorist documents the struggle of a task force to replace torture with cunning. Alexander and his team got to know their enemies, carefully questioning a rogue&#39;s gallery of egomaniacs, fanatical adolescents, and smug clerics, as well as a number of people for whom collaboration with terrorists was a financial rather than ideological decision. Before long, negotiation and manipulation had yielded stunning results and allowed them to ferret out one of the world&#39;s most elusive criminals. How to Break a Terrorist reads like taut true crime but also serves as a timely reminder that we do not have to become our enemy to defeat him.I grew intrigued by the subject of interrogation in 2001, not long after the September 11th attacks, because to combat small cells of terror-bent fanatics, the essential military tool would not be weaponry, but knowledge. How do you obtain information about a secretive enemy? There is, of course, spying, both electronic and human. America is perhaps the most capable nation in the world at the former, and would have to get better fast at the latter. The third tool, potentially the most useful and problematic, would be interrogation. Long after US troops leave Iraq and even Afghanistan, the work of defeating Islamic fanatics will go on worldwide. We need more talented gators like Matthew, ideally ones with broad knowledge and experience in the parts of the world where they work, with fluency in local languages and dialects, and with a subtle understanding of what makes people tick. Because if you know that, you also know what makes them talk. <br>- Mark Bowden, author of Black Hawk Down</p><h2>Age of Conan: Songs of Victory: Legends of Kern, Volume IIl</h2><p>The army of Kern "Wolf-Eye" has been scattered, and as the dead are buried, the tribes gather to choose new leaders.<br><br>To prove his worth, Kern must seek out the House of Crom, where rests a weapon of legend that can kill any man, beast, or god.

That means that if any of the holographic hosts fall asleep, they will go into comas-permanently. Filled with action and brimming with the same meticulous detail as <i>The Kingdom Keepers: Disney After Dark</i>, this second book in the series<i>-Disney at Dawn-</i>is the result of hands-on research behind the scenes at Disney's Animal Kingdom Park. Young and older readers alike will get a glimpse into a second Disney kingdom. The wild rides have only just begun; and the clock is ticking. How long can the teens keep themselves awake in their quest to find their friend-and what happens if they fail?</p><p>Ridley Pearson is the best-selling co-author of <em>Peter and the Starcatchers,&nbsp;Peter and the Shadow Thieves, </em>and <em>Peter and the Secret of Rundoon</em>.

In this second volume of a series, the teens are fighting Disney cartoon villains who have come to life and are trying to take control of the Disney Animal Kingdom theme park. If the heroes fall asleep, the villains can destroy them. Christopher Lane helpfully gives the characters distinct voices, but, in delivering the action-packed plot, he reads too quickly. This hurried narration, combined with occasional editing and attribution errors, will distract the careful listener. Still, Disney aficionados and action fans may overlook these flaws and revel in the wealth of behind-the-scenes details. G.D. � AudioFile 2008, Portland, Maine</p><h2>Romance</h2><p>It&#39;s not a mystery, it&#39;s a story of survival and triumph. That&#39;s what some people say about Romance, a would-be hit play about an actress pursued by a knife-wielding stalker. But isn&#39;t it romantic! Before the show can open, the leading lady is really attacked, outside the theater. And before the detectives of the 87th can solve that crime, the same actress is stabbed again. This time for keeps. A.D.A. Nellie Brand moves in for a murder conviction, but Detective Steve Carella is sure she&#39;s got the wrong guy, and wrestles for the case with Fat Ollie Weeks, Isola&#39;s foulest cop. While Bert Kling interviews witnesses and suspects ranging from the show&#39;s producers to the author - who has written novels about cops and knows how it&#39;s done - to the lead&#39;s lovely understudy, he can&#39;t keep his mind off what&#39;s happening to him. He&#39;s falling in love. With a doctor. Who happens to be a deputy chief surgeon. Who happens to be a black woman. In the city of Isola, nothing is black and white. In the play Romance, no one is guilty or innocent. And in the gritty reality of the 87th Precinct, everyone is in love with something - even if it&#39;s only murder.</p><p><i>Romance</i> is in the air as McBain, acknowledged master of the hard-boiled police procedural, offers up another surefire best-seller. This time, McBain evokes a certain whimsical lightheartedness--albeit mixed with his usual tough violence. Actress Michelle Cassidy is starring in an insipid mystery called <i>Romance</i>, and in an effort to get some much-needed publicity for the play, she persuades her lover to give her a couple of realistic-looking but superficial stab wounds. The trick works, and the play's assured of success until someone fatally stabs Michelle, then pushes the show's stage manager out a tenth-story window. Which of the characters from the play--the Detective? the Stage Manager? the Understudy?--had the most to gain from the two deaths? Steve Carella and his partner, Bert Kling, try to figure it all out. McBain toys with readers by using a number of devices to spice the story, such as a play within a play, a play on words, and the way events in real life keep imitating art. And he includes a bit of real-life romance, too, as whitebread Detective Berg's hot love affair with ebony-skinned Dr. Sharyn Cooke sizzles amidst the murder and mayhem. As usual, McBain and the 87th Precinct produce another gem. <i>Jasmine Nights</i>Romance and drama capture police detectives Carella and Kling of the 87th Precinct in McBain's Manhattan clone, Isola City. An actress in a play about an actress who gets stabbed is stabbed. Her superficial wound draws little blood but enough media attention, perhaps, to save the drama from the opening-night closing its director expects. The play is titled Romance, a subject very much the focus of Kling's personal life as he doggedly pursues another cop-black surgeon, Sharyn Cooke. Next, a cast member is fatally stabbed and another member of the company dies in a suspicious fall out of an apartment window, giving the case some urgency and, not incidentally, stirring up ugly interprecinct politics, notably with Carella and King's loathed colleague, Fat Ollie Weeks. McBain has fun in this 48th 87th precinct tale, weaving romantic dialogue into the investigation and taking shots at various dramatis personae of the theater world. When McBain has fun, so do his readers.

Some of them had been proper young ladies stranded abroad by the German invasion of France; others had scaled the Pyr�n�es by night to escape the Nazi occupation. All of them had a deep desire to help liberate their nation, and if they couldn't fight, driving an ambulance would have to do. Organized in New York by a wealthy American widow determined to create an all-female ambulance corps, they served with unflinching courage--saving soldiers from burning camps, dodging bombs, bullets, and mines, and even talking their way out of German hands. With colorful, brave characters and fierce battle scenes, <i>Women of Valor</i> is both a gripping and delightful read.</p></p><p><p><b>Ellen Hampton</b> is a journalist who has covered Latin American politics, economics, and the wars in Nicaragua and El Salvador for <i>Cox Newspapers</i>.

But all efforts of the British anti-slavery patrols to curb a flourishing trade in human life are hampered by unsuitable ships, and the indifference of a government more concerned with old enemies made distrustful allies, and the continuing belligerence of the Dey of Algiers, which threatens to ignite a full-scale war. <br> <br>For Adam, also, there is no peace.

Corona is a fantasy world regularly menaced by the "demon dactyl" who organizes the usual suspects--goblins, dwarfs, giants--in hope of wiping out humanity. Having been comprehensively blown up in book one, the now bodiless demon resorts to corrupting the soul of the abbot who is Corona's chief religious leader. It's an easy task, since despite a few good monks the church is already a murderous, hypocritical outfit. <p> On the other side, Elbryan the elf-trained warrior and his magic-wielding lady are busy cleaning up the increasingly disorganized remnants of the demon's armies, with skilled assistance from elf and thief companions. The magic comes from stones and jewels with various interesting powers, liberated from the church by a renegade monk in book one. This annoys the Abbot no end, and his "Brother Justice" assassins are hot on the stones' trail, bumping off rival clerics and innocent bystanders en route. </p><p> There's plenty of slick incidental adventure and skirmishing, and even an exciting raid on the torture chambers of the biggest and best-defended abbey.

An author and journalist, Orwell was one of the most prominent and influential figures in twentieth-century literature. His unique political allegory Animal Farm was published in 1945, and it was this novel, together with the dystopia of Nineteen Eighty-Four (1949), which brought him world-wide fame.

And don&#x2019;t miss another delightful tale about this beloved pachyderm: <i>Horton Hears a Who!</i></p><p>Poor Horton. Dr. Seuss's kindly elephant is persuaded to sit on an egg while its mother, the good-for-nothing bird lazy Maysie, takes a break. Little does Horton know that Maysie is setting off for a permanent vacation in Palm Springs. He waits, and waits, never leaving his precarious branch, even through a freezing winter and a spring that's punctuated by the insults of his friends. ("They taunted. They teased him. They yelled 'How Absurd! Old Horton the Elephant thinks he's a bird!'") Further indignities await, but Horton has the patience of Job--from whose story this one clearly derives--and he is rewarded in the end by the surprise birth of... an elephant-bird. <i>Horton Hatches the Egg</i> contains some of Theodor Geisel's most inspired verse and some of his best-ever illustrations, the dated style of which only accentuates their power and charm.

Dragons with no remorse, no sympathy, no use for humans; dragons who destroyed an entire village and everyone in it. Everyone, that is, except the young boy Arlian. Orphaned and alone, Arlian was captured by looters and sold as a mining slave. He finally escaped, fueled by years of hatred and a personal vow to bring justice to all who had wronged him. <br><br>After killing those who enslaved him, Arlian sought out <i>The Dragon Society</i>, whose sworn purpose was to stand against the dragon menace. It was there, among his peers, that Arlian discovered he is humanity's best hope for defeating the dragons . . . permanently.<br><br>Now, Arlian seeks his final vengeance: death to all of dragonkind. But as he begins to destroy the evil beasts, wild magic seeps into the Lands of Men, sowing chaos and destruction in its wake. Will Arlian's all-consuming quest for justice consume humanity as well?

This book is as rich in incident and idea as its predecessors, but if you are looking for easy reading or sauntering into Watt-Evans' three-volume roadshow for the bang-up ending, it won't be obliging.

As winter grips Richmond, Virginia, an air of somberness pervades chief medical examiner Kay Scarpetta's world. Her beloved niece Lucy is involved in a dangerous undercover police operation in Miami, and auntie fears for her life. A tyrannical new deputy chief, Diane Bray, wants to get Kay's department under her jurisdiction. Meanwhile, back at the office, someone has tinkered with the e-mail system, stealing Kay's identity, and sending off slanderous and hurtful messages. Emotionally battered, Scarpetta fears she is going insane. Or, could it be that someone is deliberately sowing this harvest of sorrow? <p> Despite her personal problems, Scarpetta is still the reigning diva at the department of death. She is sent to investigate the putrefied remains of a man found inside a container ship, "eyes bulged froglike, and the scalp and beard were sloughing off with the outer layer of darkening skin." Kay finds strange, animal-like hairs on the man's clothing--the same hairs that she discovers on a murdered store clerk a few days later. In actuality, the bizarre killings extend well beyond Virginia; whoever killed the Richmond victims also butchered people in France. Kay and police captain Pete Marino are whisked off to Paris where they must collect top-secret information from a Paris morgue, and avoid becoming victims themselves.</p><p> This macabre tome is the stuff that classic Scarpetta tales are made of: creepy but compulsive autopsy scenes, plentiful plot twists, and the compelling, if slightly more vulnerable chief medical examiner herself. <i>--Naomi Gesinger</i></p>Patricia Cornwell&#39;s most recent bestsellers include Red Mist, Port Mortuary, and Portrait of a Killer: Jack the RipperCase Closed.

He presents a vision of Istanbul as an urban cultural center, rich with the incandescence of its past--a city of minarets and pigeons rising to the heavens during the early-morning call to Muslim prayers--yet also a city riddled with ATM machines and clothed in designer jeans. Webb began photographing Istanbul in 1998, and became instantly enthralled: by the people, the layers of culture and history, the richness of street life. But what particularly drew him in was a sense of Istanbul as a border city, lying between Europe and Asia. &#34;For 30-some years as a photographer, I have been intrigued by borders, places where cultures come together, sometimes easily, sometimes roughly.&#34; The resulting body of work, some of Webb&#39;s strongest to date, conveys the frisson of a culture in transition, yet firmly rooted in a complex history. With essay by the Nobel Prize winning novelist, Orhan Pamuk.</p><p>Alex Webb is best known for his vibrant and complex color photography, often made in Latin America and the Caribbean. He has published eleven books, including Violet Isle: A Duet of Photographs from Cuba (with Rebecca Norris Webb) and The Suffering of Light, a collection of thirty years of his color work.

Clearly, eighteenth-century Philadelphians were drawn to the tavern. In addition to the obvious lure of the liquor, taverns offered overnight accommodations, meals, and stabling for visitors. They also served as places to gossip, gamble, find work, make trades, and gather news.</p><p>In <i>Rum Punch and Revolution</i>, Thompson shows how the public houses provided a setting in which Philadelphians from all walks of life revealed their characters and ideas as nowhere else. He takes the reader into the cramped confines of the colonial bar room, describing the friendships, misunderstandings and conflicts which were generated among the city's drinkers and investigates the profitability of running a tavern in a city which, until independence, set maximum prices on the cost of drinks and services in its public houses.</p><p>Taverngoing, Thompson writes, fostered a sense of citizenship that influenced political debate in colonial Philadelphia and became an issue in the city's revolution. Opinionated and profoundly undeferential, taverngoers did more than drink; they forced their political leaders to consider whether and how public opinion could be represented in the counsels of a newly independent nation.</p></p><p>Peter Thompson is Sydney Mayer Lecturer in Early American History at the University of Oxford and a Fellow of St. Cross College.<p>"A gold mine. . . .

Funny name for a man who has threatened the United States with nuclear war, who has made common cause with Islamic terrorists against the United States, and whose people risk death to escape him. But there&#x2019;s a lot that Hollywood liberals and other Fidel Castro admirers would rather you didn&#x2019;t know about the dictator of Cuba like how he imprisoned more people as a percentage of population than Hitler or Stalin; how Fidel&#x2019;s firing squads killed thousands of Cubans; how Fidel&#x2019;s subjects would rather inject themselves with AIDS than live under his tyranny. Drawing on a wealth of research including interviews with former Castro regime officials, anti-Castro freedom fighters, and Castro&#x2019;s political prisoners acclaimed author Humberto Fontova reveals the ugly face of the Castro regime. Along the way, he punctures some of the egregious myths about Cuba: � The Motorcycle Bore: The real Che Guevara not the rebel rock star of T-shirt fame, but a battlefield incompetent, a puritan-Stalinist bore, and the man who sent thousands of innocent Cubans to the firing squads � Communist Economics 101: How Castro took Cuba from being a First World economy that had to turn away European emigrants to a country that even impoverished Haitians won&#x2019;t emigrate to, with among the highest suicide and abortion rates in the world � The Saddam Hussein Next Door: How Castro has not only had nuclear weapons (and wanted to launch them) but has plotted massive terrorist outrages against the United States � Fidel the anti-black racist and unrepentant Communist and his long list of useful idiots: from Jesse Jackson to Oliver Stone, George McGovern to Ted Turner, Bill Clinton to Steven Spielberg, to Katie Couric and many others � The Left&#x2019;s favorite racism: against conservative Cuban-Americans<br>Fidel: Hollywood&#x2019;s Favorite Tyrant is a stunning expos� of the real Fidel Castro and of the hypocrisy, ignorance, and inexcusable appeasement that makes his liberal admirers notorious.</p><p>Cuban-born Humberto Fontova came to the United States when he was six years old and grew up in New Orleans.

Safely nestled between the covers of <i>Where Have You Been?</i>, he offers a hand to guide us and an encouraging whisper in our ear, leading us on a trip through what to read, how to think, and why to like. And while these essays bear sharp insights that will help us revisit writers with a fresh eye, they are also a story of love between a reader and his treasured books.<br> In the thirty essays collected here, Hofmann brings his signature wit and sustained critical mastery to a poetic, penetrating, and candid discussion of the writers and artists of the last hundred years. Here are the indispensable poets without which contemporary poetry would be unimaginable&#x2015;Elizabeth Bishop, "the poets' poets' poet," the "ghostly skill" of Robert Lowell, and the man he calls the greatest English poet since Shakespeare, Ted Hughes. But he also illumines the despair of John Berryman and the antics of poetry's bogeyman, Frederick Seidel.<br> In essays on art that are themselves works of art, Hofmann's agile and brilliant mind explores a panoply of subjects from the mastery of translation to the best day job for a poet. What these diverse gems share are the critic's insatiable curiosity and great charm. <i>Where Have You Been?</i> is an unmissable journey with literature's most irresistible flaneur.</p></p><p><p><b>Michael Hofmann</b> is an acclaimed poet, translator, and critic.

He currently teaches poetry and translation at the University of Florida.</p><p>BISHOP/LOWELL CORRESPONDENCE</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p><i>Words in Air</i> is such a formidably and dramatically and lingeringly wonderful book, it is hard to know where to begin. Well, begin in the manner of the physical geographer and the embarrassed statistician and the value-for-money merchant, with quantity, though that&#x2019;s absolutely the wrong place. Here then are 459 letters, 300 of them not previously published, exchanged over thirty years, between 1947 when the two great poets of late twentieth-century America first met&#x2014;Robert Lowell just thirty, Elizabeth Bishop thirty-six, both with one trade book and one round of prizes under their belts&#x2014;and 1977 when Lowell predeceased his friend by two years; covering all told some nine hundred pages from Bishop endpapers&#x2014;one hand-scrawled, one typed&#x2014;to Lowell endpapers&#x2014;one in his laborious, also not greatly legible child-print (&#x201c;I know I&#x2019;m myself beyond self-help, and at least you can spell&#x201d;), one typed. The apparatus of footnotes, chronology, and compendious glossary of names&#x2014;take a bow, Saskia Hamilton&#x2014;is modest, helpful, and accurate. At this point in our postepistolary (no joke), postliterary, almost postalphabetical decline, we would probably receive any collection of letters with a feeling of stupefied wistfulness and a sigh of valediction, but <i>Words in Air</i> is way beyond generic. It feels like a necessary and a culminating book, especially for Bishop. To read, it is completely engrossing, to the extent that I feel I have been trekking through it on foot for months, and I don&#x2019;t know where else I&#x2019;ve been. &#x201c;Why, page 351,&#x201d; I would say. &#x201c;Letter #229; March 1, 1961. Lowell&#x2019;s forty-fourth birthday. Where did you think?&#x201d;</p> <p>But what is it like? How in fact do you read it? &#x201c;I am underlining like Queen Victoria,&#x201d; Bishop remarks at one stage. How do you filter, assimilate, crunch it down to the space of a review? Its eight hundred pages of letters&#x2014;every one of them bearing my ambiguous slashes of delight, interest, demurral, startlement&#x2014;still left me with eight sheets full of page numbers of my own. It&#x2019;s like starting with a city and ending up with a phone book&#x2014;hardly useful as a redaction. Really, I might as well have held a pencil to the margin and kept it there, for bulk reread.</p> <p>It&#x2019;s an epistolary novel, if not a full-blown romance, then at least at moments an <i>amiti� amoureuse</i>. It&#x2019;s a variation on Garc�a M�rquez&#x2019;s <i>Love in the Time of Cholera</i>. Or it&#x2019;s an <i>Entwicklungsroman</i> in later life, both parties already poets but perhaps more importantly still on the way to becoming poets, as perhaps one only ever and always <i>is becoming</i> a poet. It&#x2019;s an ideally balanced, ideally complex account of a friendship, a race, a decades-long conspiracy, a dance (say, a tango?). It&#x2019;s a cocktail of infernal modesty and angelic pride. It&#x2019;s a further episode in Bishop&#x2019;s increasingly sweeping posthumous triumph over her more obvious, more ambitious, more square-toed friend. It&#x2019;s a rat-a-tat-tat Ping-Pong rally, an artillery exchange, a story told in fireworks, a trapeze show. One can read it for gifts sent up and down the Atlantic, from Lowell&#x2019;s traditional northeast seaboard to Bishop&#x2019;s serendipitously arrived-at Brazil, where she mostly lived from 1951, having disembarked from a freighter for a short visit; for projects completed, adapted, revised, abandoned, published, and responded to; for blurbs solicited, struggled with, and delivered to greater or lesser satisfaction; for houses bought and done up and left; for other partners encountered and set down; for visits and time together passionately contrived, put off, and subsequently held up to memory or guiltily swept under the carpet; for gossip and the perennial trade in reputations; for a startlingly unabashed revelation of mutual career aid (&#x201c;we may be a terrible pair of log-rollers, I don&#x2019;t know,&#x201d; writes Bishop in 1965, having asked Lowell for a blurb for <i>Questions of Travel</i> after he had asked her for one for <i>Life Studies</i>); for loyalty and scruple, independent thinking and prudent silence, insistent generosity and occasional self-seeking; a longing to submit to the other&#x2019;s perceived discipline and a desire to offer unconditional admiration; for personal, professional, and public events. One can read it for movements of place, gaps in time, and discrepancies and disharmonies in feeling or balance; for the dismayed Bishop&#x2019;s agonized criticism of aspects of two of Lowell&#x2019;s books, the rather coarse free translations in <i>Imitations</i> of 1961, and the use of private letters from his second wife, Elizabeth Hardwick, in <i>The Dolphin</i> of 1973; for various other crises and cruxes: their heady, teasy-flirty mutual discovery of 1947, Bishop&#x2019;s difficult visit to a near-manic Lowell in Maine in 1957, Lowell&#x2019;s visit to Brazil and another manic episode in 1962, the death by suicide of Bishop&#x2019;s companion, Lota de Macedo Soares, in 1967, Bishop&#x2019;s uneasy return to Boston (to fill in for Lowell&#x2019;s absence, if you please), and Lowell&#x2019;s ultimate shuttling between wives and countries of the late 1970s. It&#x2019;s social history, comedy of manners, American dissidence, the search for a style. It&#x2019;s not least a gender myth more astute about men and women than that of Atalanta and Hippolytus (in any case, I always think Atalanta, like Bishop, should have won&#x2014;<i>she</i> should have been provided with the apples, and Hippolytus, the ambitious, distractable male, goofed off in their pursuit, rather than the other way round). He is her anchor, she his kite.</p> <p>The haunting issue in these letters is how much the vast difference between their authors brings them together and how much it pulls them apart. Because that Lowell and Bishop are unmistakably and unignorably and quite intractably dissimilar, of that there can be no doubt. The letters might as well have been printed in different type or different colors, so little is there ever any question of who is writing. (Which, if you think about it, is rather striking over some eight hundred pages of often close personal communication.) Even when, in the manner of friends, Lowell mimics Bishop, or Bishop teases Lowell, there is no real blurring of identities. The attraction of opposites is a simplification in this context, but the Lowell-Bishop association does bring to mind the school construction of a molecule: the proton (Lowell) massive, positively charged, hugging the center, and the electron (Bishop) almost weightless, negatively charged, speedy and peripheral and orbiting.</p> <p>All this is exacerbated, of course, by the way one reads, which is to question, to cross-refer and compare, to doubt, to go behind the back of words, to tap for hollowness and cracks and deadness. One reads not with a vise or glue, but with a hammer and chisel, or an awl. It&#x2019;s not&#x2014;or at least not by intention, or not immediately&#x2014;a consolidating or fortifying activity, but more like looking for safe passage across a frozen river. Hence, the very form of this book&#x2014;not one voice, but two voices, and then such different voices and such completely different temperaments&#x2014;inclines one to further doubt. It&#x2019;s as though two incompatibles had rebased themselves and in some Nietzschean way sworn undying loyalty. The loyalty, whether unspoken or occasionally voiced along the lines of &#x201c;I don&#x2019;t know what I&#x2019;d do without you,&#x201d; one tends to disregard&#x2014;it makes, as it were, the hard covers for this book&#x2014;while the reader is again and again made aware of the incompatibility, which is everything in between.</p> <p>The thought came to me early on that this is a dialogue of the deaf, or to put it in the way I first conceived: it&#x2019;s like an arm writing to a leg. It&#x2019;s all a matter of what you want to do: tickle or walk. Bishop is acute, Lowell obtuse; Bishop sensitive, solicitous, moody; Lowell dull, sometimes careless, rather relentlessly productive; she is anxious, he, when not shockingly and I think genuinely self-critical, insouciant; she is open to the world, whereas with him&#x2014;and this is an understatement&#x2014;&#x201c;sometimes nothing is so solid to me as writing&#x201d;; her poems in her account of them are fickle, small scale, barely worth pursuing&#x2014;and how many of them seem to get lost in the making&#x2014;whereas his are industrial-scale drudgery and then quite suddenly completed. It seems symptomatic that as these letters begin, Lowell is working on his long poem, &#x201c;The Mills of the Kavanaughs,&#x201d; &#x201c;12 hours a day&#x2014;it&#x2019;s now 24 sections of almost 400 lines, and I think it may go to about 50 sections,&#x201d; only for that to be followed by his prose memoir in the &#x2019;50s, various translations and dramatic adaptations in the &#x2019;60s and &#x2019;70s&#x2014;<i>Imitations</i>, <i>The Old Glory</i>, <i>Oresteia</i>, <i>Phaedra</i>&#x2014;and the several versions of another &#x201c;section&#x201d; poem, <i>Notebook</i>, followed by another long poem, <i>The Dolphin</i>. He writes like a man consumed&#x2014;and not at all made happy&#x2014;by his own industry, a sort of tin Midas: &#x201c;I have a four hundred line sequence poem which might make a book, twenty pages on a New England essay, and my obituary on Randall. Thank God, we two still breathe the air of the living.&#x201d; If Lowell proceeds like a bricklayer&#x2014;you see the string and the plumb line, everything is so and so many courses of bricks&#x2014;Bishop is like a butterfly hunter, now one, now another, in pretty pursuit, a little forlorn, and likely to come home at night with nothing to show for a day&#x2019;s gallivanting. (Strange to think that they were both fisherfolk, and on occasions fished together.) She is much more protective of her poems too, either not mentioning them at all, or else habitually deprecating them: &#x201c;I have two new ones I&#x2019;ll send you when I get back, but not very serious ones I&#x2019;m afraid.&#x201d; Even length&#x2014;and the term is relative&#x2014;is not comforting to her, but rather the opposite: &#x201c;However I have just about finished a long &amp; complicated one about Key West.&#x201d; The poem in question is &#x201c;The Bight,&#x201d; which is all of thirty-six lines.</p> <p>The catalog of differences goes on. Not only is Lowell a sort of monad of literature, with little interest outside its bounds&#x2014;his occasional comments on painters seem dull and contrived, and in music as well he lags way behind Bishop, a one-time music major, who is capable of recommending jazz clubs in Boston, Gesualdo, Purcell, Webern, and Brazilian sambas, all with deep knowledge and understanding&#x2014;even within it he is drawn with laddish&#x2014;or loutish&#x2014;insistence to the monumental, the papier-m�ch�, the <i>Ben-Hur</i>. The contrast in their reading is illuminating: he comes to her, at various times, with Faulkner, Pope, <i>Middlemarch</i>, Chaucer, Dryden, Tasso, Shakespeare, Carlyle, Macaulay, <i>Dr. Zhivago</i>, &#x201c;all of Thucydides. Isn&#x2019;t Moli�re swell!&#x201d;; she counters with <i>Marius the Epicurean</i>, Frank O&#x2019;Hara, Captain Slocum, Mme. de S�vign� (&#x201c;so much better than most things written on purpose&#x201d;&#x2014;which might be an epigraph for the present volume), Sergey Aksakov. It&#x2019;s not that her writers are impressively obscure or recherch�&#x2014;though they are that, too!&#x2014;they bespeak a taste as his, frankly, don&#x2019;t. They are the product of longer and more grown-up searching. This emerges beautifully in one of the most lovely and softly assertive passages of hers in the book, where she is talking initially about an Anton Webern record, then makes this into nothing less than an <i>ars poetica</i>:</p> <p>I am crazy about some of the short instrumental pieces. They seem exactly like what I&#x2019;d always wanted, vaguely, to hear and never had, and really &#x201c;contemporary.&#x201d; That strange kind of modesty that I think one feels in almost everything contemporary one really likes&#x2014;Kafka, say, or Marianne, or even Eliot, and Klee and Kokoschka and Schwitters&nbsp;&#x2026; Modesty, care, <i>space</i>, a sort of helplessness but determination at the same time.</p> <p>This brave and smart piece of improvisation, on an aesthetic that is not even wholly <i>her own</i>, and fighting contrary tendencies in Kokoschka and Eliot, at least, is surely quite beyond Lowell, whose programmatic remarks in books and interviews are few, lazy, and approximate&#x2014;which might not seem to matter very much, except that the regrettable &#x201c;confessional&#x201d; label has gone by default.</p> <p>Literary style is another constant source of difference. Bishop has humor&#x2014;the lovely air of amusement and being amused that plays over almost everything she writes&#x2014;Lowell has the more deliberate, more solitary quality of wit. I don&#x2019;t think Oscar Wilde ever wrote or said anything wittier than Lowell&#x2019;s observation&#x2014;itself a witty variation on Juvenal&#x2014;on his friend (and regular bone of contention in this correspondence: he likes him, she doesn&#x2019;t) Randall Jarrell: &#x201c;Then Randall thinks nothing adult is human.&#x201d; Bishop seeks balance and harmony, even in her most far-flung sentences, so that one&#x2019;s impression is of a chord: &#x201c;The man wore a very strange buttoned bow-tie, and as a youth he had carried gold, around his waist, for Wells Fargo.&#x201d; (Who else would have thought to make one sentence out of that?) Lowell is drawn to energy, imbalance, exaggeration, caricature; here he is on his son, aged just one: &#x201c;We&#x2019;ll be at Bill Alfred&#x2019;s sometime after the 15th, though I dread the effect of Sheridan on Bill&#x2019;s fragile furniture. Unfortunately he has made great strides in the last month and now walks, and I think takes strength exercises. A little girl visited him and he looked in contrast like a golden gorilla.&#x201d; To such a distanced, perhaps word-bound, way of looking (remember, please, those &#x201c;great strides&#x201d; are literal), everything is apt to seem monstrous; and did anyone ever use the little word &#x201c;girl&#x201d; with that undertow of sexual speculation with which Lowell always endows it? Bishop noticed it too: in &#x201c;North Haven,&#x201d; her marvelous elegy for him, she has, &#x201c;Years ago, you told me it was here / (in 1932?) you first &#x2018;discovered <i>girls</i>.&#x2019;&#x201d; There seem to be almost two competing notions of literature at work here: to Bishop it is seeing everything clearly and fairly and in complicated harmony, through to the horizon; to Lowell it is something compacted and impacted, often a single quality driven in and in on itself, somehow caricatured even when kind. He <i>does</i> have some wonderful passages, but they seem&#x2014;compared to hers&#x2014;so utterly planned and worked: the account of a literary conference in New York, the description of a weekend&#x2019;s sailing in Maine with the Eberharts and others, a piece of passionate recollection of Delmore Schwartz (on July 16, 1966), which reaches the level of his brilliant published memoirs of Randall Jarrell and Allen Tate:</p> <p>Delmore in an unpressed mustard gabardine, a little winded, husky voiced, unhealthy, but with a carton of varied vitamin bottles, the color of oil, quickening with Jewish humor, and in-the-knowness, and his own genius, every person, every book&#x2014;motives for everything, Freud in his blood, great webs of causation, then suspicion, then rushes of rage. He was more reasonable than us, but obsessed, a much better mind, but one already chasing the dust&#x2014;it was like living with a sluggish, sometimes angry spider&#x2014;no hurry, no motion, Delmore&#x2019;s voice, almost inaudible, dead, intuitive, pointing somewhere, then the strings tightening, the roar of rage&#x2014;too much, too much for us!</p> <p>This is hammer work, a hammer on the piano or a hammer on the drums; Bishop makes writing seem like breathing.</p> <p>If one leaves the sheltered hunting grounds of literature&#x2014;as to an extent we have already&#x2014;then the differences grow still more apparent. Bishop likes strong Brazilian coffee, Lowell drinks American dishwater coffee (or tea, sometimes he&#x2019;s not sure). Bishop is the one who brings in words&#x2014;<i>desmarcar</i>, &#x201c;when you want to get out of an engagement,&#x201d; or &#x201c;found a lovely word at Jane Dewey&#x2019;s&#x2014;you probably know it&#x2014;ALLELOMIMETIC. (Don&#x2019;t DARE use it!),&#x201d; and she is the one, too, whose work requires a dictionar...</p></p><h2>Custom Knit Jackets: Casual to Couture</h2><p>With one master pattern, this resource guides knitters through creating 12 jacket silhouettes in five standard sizes, with four different weights of yarn.

I was on a high school graduation adventure with my boarding school roommate, Maria, and her sister Johanna. We bought Eurail passes and spent two months traveling around France, Italy, Germany, and Czechoslovakia. We arrived in Paris on a hot June morning, bunked in a youth hostel on the rue des Barres behind the H�tel de Ville, and made a beeline for Berthillon, the ice cream parlor on the �le Saint-Louis that Johanna&#x2019;s worldly older boyfriend had told her had the best ice cream in the world. It was true. I still remember the intense flavor of the side-by-side scoops of raspberry and lemon-lime sorbet. Everything about Paris was more intense, from the sorbet flavors to the cornflower-blue sky stretched over the sharp spire of Sainte-Chapelle to the scarlet poppies poking out of green grass squares in the Luxembourg Gardens to the acrid smell of urine in the long, white-tiled M�tro corridors.<br><br>For two weeks we walked and walked, restlessly roaming from Right Bank to Left, through lush displays of dahlias and roses in the �le de la Cit� flower market, past the stout Gothic turrets of the Conciergerie, and over the Pont Neuf to the boulevard Saint-Michel. We walked from the Jardin des Plantes to the Eiffel Tower and then crossed the Seine again on the Pont de l&#x2019;Alma, taking in the golden shadows of Paris at dusk. Every streetscape and boulevard seemed to shimmer in the heat and summer light like an Impressionist tableau. We visited the Louvre, Notre Dame, and Sacr�-C&#x153;ur. We rolled down the grassy hillside of the Parc des Buttes Chaumont and ate buttered baguettes with thick slabs of boiled ham. In the evening we counted out chunky ten-franc coins and splurged on steak au poivre and cheap Beaujolais at Aux Charpentiers.<br><br>Something about the majestic landscape moved me in ways I didn&#x2019;t quite understand: the shock of history. Everywhere I looked, the past was present. On the sides of the limestone buildings, brass plaques memorialized fallen soldiers and members of the French Resistance. The parks, the broad, slick paving stones on the boulevards, even the light had been immortalized by the Impressionist painters. So much texture and flavor! Twenty kinds of bread were splayed out in bakery windows; boisterous caf�s spilled over with students, professors, prostitutes, and ouvriers, workers in their cobalt-blue jumpsuits.<br><br>When the summer ended, I headed off for my freshman year at Princeton and was immersed in an all-American preppy campus that was a world apart from the bohemian Paris that had moved me to my soul. Within a few weeks, I fell in love with a sophomore named Will who, like me, had grown up in the prep school tradition of the East Coast. Will was confident about his place at Princeton, not intimidated by ambitious classmates or the grind for grades. He laughed at me for trying to read every book on every syllabus, for rushing over to Firestone Library after dinner. On weekends we&#x2019;d go to drunken parties in the basements of eating clubs like Cap and Gown or the Tiger Inn, where masses of people would dance to one-hit wonders. &#x201c;Everybody wants to rule the world,&#x201d; we sang along, punching the air with our hands and skidding around the beer-soaked tile floor in our acid-washed jeans and Laura Ashley blouses. Yeah, we were gonna rule the world, at least until 2:00 a.m., when many of the party animals were vomiting in the gutter.<br><br>I was interested in fashion, and that made me a bit of an anomaly on campus. Style was part of my upbringing. New York in the seventies was defined by larger-than-life style icons like Bianca Jagger, Halston, Diane von Furstenberg, and Andy Warhol.<br><br>My mother and father had divorced when I was six. I was never sure why exactly&#x2014;we didn&#x2019;t talk about it&#x2014;but I remember a kid pointing at me in second grade and whispering to her friend, &#x201c;Her parents are divorced.&#x201d; In those days, at that school, divorce was rare. A few years later my mother moved my sister, my brother, and me into an apartment on East 63rd Street just off Park Avenue, across the street from Halston. Warhol lived two blocks up; my brother and I would see him with Liza Minnelli in the butcher on Lexington Avenue. We stayed with my dad every other weekend and on Wednesday nights. He was an architect and had a strict aesthetic inspired by Le Corbusier, Louis Kahn, and the Color Field painters of the 1950s. His apartment, across the street from the Museum of Modern Art, was all white, with recessed lighting and the latest Eames chairs. He was passionate about art and architecture and would take us on excursions to the Museum of Modern Art or to SoHo and would talk endlessly about painters like Frank Stella and Franz Kline and the art scene in the sixties. He loved to tell the story of a trip to Paris as a newlywed, when my mother dragged him to a concert. It was �dith Piaf&#x2019;s last. &#x201c;You never know,&#x201d; he would say, &#x201c;what you might learn or see.&#x201d; He was strict and aloof in a way that my mother was not, but he cared about manners education&#x2014;cultural education. &#x201c;You are barbarians!&#x201d; he would say when my brother and I complained about yet another museum.<br><br>As a teenager I devoured copies of Vogue and French Elle and Carrie Donovan&#x2019;s pages in The New York Times Magazine. From my mother I learned the power of fashion to lift a mood or transform a moment. She always said that shopping was better than therapy. If things got tense in our family, if she was fighting with my father over alimony or if my brother was expelled from yet another school, she would dash off to Bergdorf&#x2019;s to console herself with a new Jean Muir dress or a Pucci scarf. Like many young women, I used fashion to try on different personas&#x2014;one day preppy, the next day punk. In college it was a way of defining myself among the valedictorians and All-Ivy athletes. I wasn&#x2019;t wearing anything radical&#x2014;no Mohawks, no combat boots&#x2014;but the fact that I cared about how I looked, that I paid attention to my appearance, mystified my roommates. They were varsity athletes&#x2014;rowers, lacrosse players, and soccer forwards. Blow-drying my hair and putting on makeup made me something of a freak among freshmen.<br><br>Four years later, on a hot June day, I was standing under the ancient ash tree on Cannon Green, a new college graduate posing for pictures with my parents, my sister, and my grandmother. My brother had cooked up some excuse to avoid this family event. Anyone could see the unhappiness in that picture. My mother and father had been divorced for over a decade, and the years of conflict and disappointment are written in my beautiful mother&#x2019;s sad blue eyes. My father&#x2019;s posture is awkward, almost mechanical, but he&#x2019;s smiling his goofy smile, and his fierce brown eyes are filled with pride. I&#x2019;m smiling, too, a weary smile brought on by too many champagne parties and the futile feeling that I would always be caught in my parents&#x2019; tug-of-war. Only my eighty-two-year-old grandmother, once statuesque but now hunched over with age, seems oblivious to the tension.<br><br>&#x201c;I have something for you,&#x201d; my grandmother said after my mother and father had retreated to their separate corners of the green. She thrust a small box into my hand. &#x201c;Make sure you read the card.&#x201d;<br><br>In the box was a pair of small perfect round diamond studs. My grandmother believed every young woman should mark important occasions with talismans, preferably beautiful jewelry.<br><br>&#x201c;Oh, thank you, Libby!&#x201d; I kissed her on her soft, powdery cheek.<br><br>The note card had four dates scrawled in her loopy handwriting: &#x201c;1986, 1956, 1926, 1893.&#x201d; The years my father, and his father, and his father before him had graduated from Princeton. Looking down at those numbers, all I could think was, Get me out of this equation. I wanted to get as far away as possible, not just from my unhappy parents but from the expectations the legacy conferred on me.<br><br>At Princeton I was the emissary of a family tradition. When I had tried to find my own way as a teenager&#x2014;for a while I had my heart set on becoming a dancer&#x2014;my father steered me back onto the college path and eventually toward Princeton. Some people are immensely proud of their family legacies; mine haunted me with the implication that I was qualified not on my own merits but because of the line I had been born into.<br><br>Everything in my life had been so predictable, so bound up in traditions I was supposed to uphold without even knowing quite what the implications were. I wanted to swerve off the path marked out by that succession of dates, to do something adventuresome and unexpected. I wasn&#x2019;t a rebel in the usual sense of breaking rules, but I had a hunger to learn something about myself&#x2014;what that was, I didn&#x2019;t exactly know.<br><br>The thing that intrigued me was journalism. As a kid, I&#x2019;d watched Barbara Walters on the Today show every morning, reporting on the war in Vietnam. She was authoritative and glamorous&#x2014;an intoxicating combination. As a freshman I had joined the staff of The Daily Princetonian. I admired the paper&#x2019;s star reporter, Crystal Nix, a brilliant six-foot-tall African American woman who made reporting look effortless, filing story after story while the rest of us in the newsroom scrambled around frantically, chasing campus news. My only front-page byline was attached to a story about zoning restrictions on a local Wawa convenience store. It was hardly what they call a Cheerio choker.<br><br>As a senior, I took a course called Politics and the Press, taught by the Vietnam correspondent Gloria Emerson. Emerson had started on the women&#x2019;s pages of The New York Times in the 1960s, reporting on events like Marc Bohan&#x2019;s Oriental-inspired collection at Dior or the arrival of longer suit jackets and ostrich trim at the Fontana sisters in Rome. By 1968, she was so fed up with the fashion beat, she asked to be transferred to Vietnam.<br><br>In my delusions of grandeur&#x2014;or out of desperation&#x2014;I thought I could make that jump, too. I could parlay my Wawa exclusive into a Time magazine gig in Paris and then transfer to Rome and end up in some remote, exotic place like Hanoi. Aspiring to become a war correspondent was romantic and sounded good on paper, but secretly, when I played out that fantasy in my head, I never made it past Paris. I was in love with fashion and culture, specifically French culture.<br><br>And yet, like most bewildered souls graduating from college, I didn&#x2019;t have a clue as to how to make it happen. I had no plans, no strategy. My friends had signed up for interviews with advertising firms like J. Walter Thompson or had applied and been accepted to law school or were taking the Foreign Service exam. They knew their starting salaries and what the next five years of their lives would look like. I knew I was supposed to make a choice and plant a flag somewhere, to locate myself physically in a way that announced I was &#x201c;starting my life.&#x201d; But all I had was an instinct that harkened back to that feeling of elation I&#x2019;d experienced in Paris four years before. I knew virtually nothing of the practical aspects of living in Paris, but I could see myself there. I could see myself in a walk-up in some exquisite limestone building on the �le Saint-Louis. I couldn&#x2019;t say what I thought I&#x2019;d find there, but I knew Paris would give me something I couldn&#x2019;t find anywhere else.<br><br>Princeton Playlist<br><br>&#x201c;I Would Die for You,&#x201d; Prince<br><br>&#x201c;What I Like About You,&#x201d; the Romantics<br><br>&#x201c;Tainted Love,&#x201d; Soft Cell<br><br>&#x201c;Everybody Wants to Rule the World,&#x201d; Tears for Fears<br><br>&#x201c;Don&#x2019;t You Want Me,&#x201d; the Human League<br><br>&#x201c;Our Lips Are Sealed,&#x201d; the Go-Go&#x2019;s<br><br>&#x201c;I Ran,&#x201d; A Flock of Seagulls<br><br>&#x201c;I Melt with You,&#x201d; Modern English<br><br>&#x201c;Save It for Later,&#x201d; the English Beat<br><br>&#x201c;Borderline,&#x201d; Madonna<br><br>&#x201c;Avalon,&#x201d; Roxy Music<br><br>&#x201c;Road to Nowhere,&#x201d; Talking Heads<br><br>&#x201c;Everyday I Write the Book,&#x201d; Elvis Costello<br><br>&#x201c;Do You Really Want to Hurt Me,&#x201d; Culture Club<br><br>chapter two<br><br>Just Go<br><br>In the months following graduation, I talked endlessly and with great bravado about my plan to live in Paris. I would find a job and learn to speak French fluently. I told my boyfriend, Will, that I&#x2019;d be gone for just a year. A year seemed like enough time to figure out what to do with the rest of my life. It certainly sounded more appealing than a year in some entry-level cubicle at J. Walter Thompson.<br><br>Secretly I was not so sure. The security of family and friends in New York made a European adventure seem daunting. I vacillated back and forth: I didn&#x2019;t know many people in Paris. Then there was the job, or, rather, the lack of a job. What would I do? I was not going to Paris to be a fl�neur, or the female version&#x2014;one of Manet&#x2019;s immaculately coiffed ladies whose sunlit garden and nineteenth-century finery were financed by her industrialist husband. I was not Hemingway or Janet Flanner, banging out newsy dispatches from a caf� over a bottle of cheap wine. All I had was an impulse to go.<br><br>My godmother, Sandy, lived in a rambling corner apartment with sweeping views of the gilded dome and esplanade of Les Invalides. She was a footloose bohemian who loved a good party and, on a whim many years earlier, had followed her boyfriend, Bob, an editor at the International Herald Tribune, to Paris. Bob kindly gave me the phone number of a woman named Maggie Shapiro, who ran the internship program at the Trib, and she offered me a stagiaire. I signed up for French classes at the Sorbonne, solicited reference letters from professors and former employers, and filled out a stack of forms for a student visa. My friend Tanya connected me with a French family who rented rooms to American students. I sold my car, had my wisdom teeth pulled, and typed up a French r�sum�. I booked a ticket on a cheap charter flight to Paris: one-way.<br><br>And then a bomb went off.<br><br>I was sitting on a rattan stool in my mother&#x2019;s kitchen when I saw the news flash on TV: an explosion in Paris. This was the fifth one in just ten days. Terrorists had been planting bombs in caf�s and M�tro stations. A grisly attack had occurred at a police station and another one at a post office in the H�tel de Ville.</p><h2>The Ragged Trousered Philanthropists (Oxford World&#39;s Classics)</h2><p>Tressell's novel is about survival on the underside of the Edwardian Twilight, about exploitative employment when the only safety nets are charity, workhouse, and grave. Following the fortunes of a group of painters and decorators and their families, and the attempts to rouse their political will by the Socialist visionary Frank Owen, the book is both a highly entertaining story and a passionate appeal for a fairer way of life. It asks questions that are still being asked today: why do your wages bear no relation to the value of your work? Why do fat cats get richer when you don't? Tressell's answers are "The Great Money Trick" and the "philanthropy" of an unenlightened workforce, who give away their rights and aspirations to a decent life so freely.<br> <br> Intellectually enlightening, deeply moving and gloriously funny (complete with exploding clergyman), <em>The Ragged Trousered Philanthropists</em> is a book that changes lives.</p><p>'The first great English novel about the class war, <i>The Ragged Trousered Philanthropists</i> is spiked, witty, humorous, instructive and full of excitement, harmony and pathos.' - ALAN SILLITOE <p>'Some books seem to batter their way to immortality against all the odds, by sheer brute artistic strength, and high up in this curious and honourable company must be counted <i>The Ragged Trousered Philanthropists</i>.

One man blows his brains out and does his lady a last favour... Alone in his cell another sets a ball rolling that may demolish a glittering career... Everyone keeps secrets and sometimes not just their own. In an Edinburgh winter the wind blows chill and penetrating. For Rebus it slams one door shut only to open another. Investigating the disappearance of the Provost&#39;s daughter leads him from the Old Town to Silicon Gel, from drug addicts to government ministers. And plants the seed that grows into a nagging belief that there may be some criminals beyond the grasp of modern justice.</p><p>Detective Inspector John Rebus is not a man easily intimidated, so when political heavyweights start to lean on the dour, moralistic Edinburgh detective to stop an investigation, Rebus doggedly digs in and follows the case as it moves from embezzlement to murder and finally to conspiracy at the highest level of government.Praise for Ian Rankin: <p>"Ian Rankin is up there among the best crime novelists at work today. His stuff is always taut, gritty, and stirring. At the heart of it stands Rebus, a character for the ages because he's a cop with style, wit, and an inalienable sense of the gray area between right and wrong." --Michael Connelly </p><p>"The progenitor--and king--of tartan noir." --James Ellroy </p><p>"A novelist of great scope, depth, and power...Brilliant." --Jonathan Kellerman </p><p>"In Rankin you cannot go wrong." --THE BOSTON GLOBE </p><p>"Ian Rankin's brilliant series featuring John Rebus is the kind of blistering police procedural that gives the genre a good name." --ENTERTAINMENT WEEKLY </p><p>"A brilliant series...the work of a master." --THE SAN FRANCISCO EXAMINER &amp; CHRONICLE </p><p>"Crime fiction at its best." --THE WASHINGTON POST BOOK WORLD </p><p>"Rankin's dexterity in juggling plots and threats and motives lights up the darkness with a poet's grace.

Scott Fitzgerald won an Edgar in 1991), despite its overwrought climax and a villain whom psychologically hip readers will spot before the actual unmasking. Former literary boy-wonder Hoagy has sunk to ghosting the showbiz autobio of children's TV star Lyle ("Uncle Chubby") Hudnut, who's attempting a comeback after an arrest for indecent exposure in a Times Square porn theater. Lyle, a 300-pound bundle of crazed energy, ego and cruelty, is sure that someone-or the world-is out to get him and believes the book will generate sympathy. There are personal complications: Lyle's co-star is his ex-wife; the network's executive producer is an ex-girlfriend; his current fiancee is the show's producer, a spot coveted by an assistant producer; and the show's writers are angling for control. A fire on the set, food poisoning and the bizarre murder of the newest cast member wreak havoc. A subplot involves Hoagy's celebrity ex-wife, who's pregnant and won't identify the father, but the best part of the book is Hoagy's gimlet-eyed observations of the fierce, delicious and dizzy infighting in Sitcom Land. <br>Copyright 1994 Reed Business Information, Inc.<i>The Uncle Chubby Show</i> is the TV sitcom sensation of the '90s, boosting its formerly third-place network into the ratings lead and making fortunes for everyone involved with the program. But all is not well in Chubbyland: the series' star, the tyrannical and possibly psychotic Lyle Hudnut, has been arrested for public indecency in a Times Square porn theater. Hudnut hires ghostwriter-to-the-stars Stewart "Hoagy" Hoag to draft a damage-controlling memoir and to serve as "feelings adviser" to his writers. Hoagy's investigation leads to a bombing on the set, a nonlethal poisoning of the show's cast and crew, and murder. Meanwhile, Hoagy has problems of his own: his ex-wife, a prominent actress, is pregnant and won't reveal the name of the baby's father to a breathless nation (or to Hoagy). Handler, an experienced television writer, has produced a thoroughly satisfying mystery that offers a cynical look at the economics, politics, and sociology of a TV sitcom. He also creates some of the best character names in the business, including guru Noble Gesture and fading TV star Chad Roe. Highly recommended. <i>George Needham</i></p><h2>Expository Sermon Outlines</h2><p>This book contains more than 200 detailed sermon outlines on theological topics that furnish the basis for Christian belief and the Christian life.

Good-natured, spirited Peep drew Heinrich into her world -- one he found to be filled with as much color and drama as that of her human counterparts.</p><p>And so, with a scientist's training and a nature lover's boundless curiosity and enthusiasm, Heinrich set out to observe and understand the travails and triumphs of the Canada geese, or honkers, living in the beaver bog adjacent to his rural Vermont home. His presence in the bog, at all hours, in all weather, became as commonplace as that of the local beavers and birds. The resident geese learned that Heinrich could be trusted, enabling him to watch and record their daily routines from up close.</p><p>Heated battles over territory, mysterious nest raids, jealousy over a lover's inattention, all are recounted here in an engaging, anecdotal narrative that sheds light on how geese live and why they behave as they do. Far from staid or predictable, the lives of geese are packed with adventure and full of surprises.</p><p>In <em>The Geese of Beaver Bog</em>, Heinrich takes his readers through mud, icy waters, and overgrown sedge hummocks into a seemingly impenetrable world. He does so with deft insight, respectful modesty, and infectious good humor. Illustrated throughout with Heinrich's trademark sketches and featuring beautiful four-color photographs, <em>The Geese of Beaver Bog</em> is part love story, part science experiment, and wholly delightful.</p></p><p><p>The author of numerous bestselling and award-winning books, Bernd Heinrich is a professor of biology at the University of Vermont. He divides his time between Vermont and the forests of western Maine.</p>Arguably today's finest naturalist author, Heinrich follows up his magnificent <i>Winter World</i> (2003) with a smaller-scale but delightful narrative of his recent observations on the Canadian geese that have colonized the beaver bog near his Vermont home. The story begins and ends with Peep, a goose who hatched from an egg on Heinrich's lawn and adopted Heinrich's family as her own. In time Peep mates with a gander, Pop, only to see all her eggs but one destroyed by an unknown predator&#x2014;Heinrich suspects other geese&#x2014;and then her sole gosling die, as she and Pop share the bog with another goose couple whom Heinrich calls Jane and Jack. The next year, Pop has coupled with Jane, while Peep, after some struggle, takes up with Jack, contradicting the common wisdom that geese pair off for years, just one of many anomalous behaviors that Heinrich observes and tries to make sense of. Other geese come and go, as Heinrich rushes from his house to the bog, often before dawn, scrupulously studying this incident or that, always tying in what he sees with scientific knowledge, relying particularly on Konrad Lorenz's groundbreaking work. The story can flag at times (these are geese, after all, not higher primates), but is always re-energized by Heinrich's enthusiasm. Other animals figure in as well&#x2014;other bird species, beavers, mammalian predators and even the author's own family&#x2014;as the seasons turn and the geese grow, in Heinrich's talented hands, into memorable characters. Backed by several useful appendixes and brightened not only by Heinrich's careful drawings but by color photos (not seen by <i>PW</i>), this is another worthy missive from our latter-day Thoreau. <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

He has won many awards for investigative journalism and magazine writing.Up-close and personal perspectives on a consequential Mafia family that law-enforcement agencies and turncoats have all but put out of business. Drawing mainly on interviews with Nick Caramandi (a confessed killer, loan shark, and extortionist now in the Federal Witness Protection Program), Philadelphia Inquirer reporter Anastasia offers a tellingly detailed rundown on a fiefdom encompassing not only his hometown but also Atlantic City from the late 1970's through the mid-1980's. During this violent period, an arguably psychopathic thug named Nicodemo Scarfo headed the local branch of La Cosa Nostra. His regime was notable for unusually savage rub- outs as well as for the systematic corruption of public and union officials. Eventually, however, the deadly don and more than a dozen of his henchmen were convicted on scores of felony murder and RICO charges in a series of trials that began in 1987. Among those responsible for putting Scarfo behind bars was Garamandi, a successful streetwise hustler who had been formally initiated into the mob. The erstwhile wiseguy broke the secret society's vow of silence and became an informer when he learned his capo had marked him for death in the wake of a failed real-estate swindle involving Philadelphia pols. The decision to eliminate Caramandi ranks among the vengeful Scarfo's worst since ``Crow'' (as he's known in gangland circles) provided government prosecutors with the firsthand dope they needed to bring a flock of kingpin outlaws to book. The gossipy stool pigeon here also provides the author an insider's savvy briefing on the quotidian world of organized crime; by Garamandi's credible account, there was appreciably more bad blood than honor among the thieves in thrall to Scarfo.

YOU ARE A BADASS AT MAKING MONEY is the book you need if you&#39;ve spent too much time watching money land in your bank account and then roll through your fingers. Jen Sincero went from living in a converted garage to traveling the world in 5-star luxury in a matter of years, and knows all too well the layers of BS one can get wrapped up in around money, as well as what it takes to dig your way out. In this funny, fascinating and practical book she goes in-depth on how powerful our thoughts are and how our bank accounts are mirrors for our beliefs about money. YOU ARE A BADASS AT MAKING MONEY combines laugh out loud comedy with life-changing concepts, all boiled down into manageable, bite-sized tips so that YOU can put them into practice and get life changing results.</p><p>Jen Sincero is a bestselling author and success coach who has helped countless people transform their personal and professional lives via her newsletters, seminars, private sessions, public appearances, articles, products, and books. A few years ago, Jen said goodbye to her home in California in order to travel the world indefinitely and encourage as many people as possible to live lives of unbridled awesomeness. She is the author of YOU ARE A BADASS and YOU ARE A BADASS AT MAKING MONEY.If you&#x2019;re ready to make more money, you can. I don&#x2019;t care how many times you&#x2019;ve tried and failed or if you&#x2019;re so broke you&#x2019;re selling your bodily fluids for bus fare or how often you&#x2019;ve found yourself center stage at the checkout counter, feigning shock and indignation: &#x201c;Are you sure? <i>Declined?!</i> That&#x2019;s impossible. Can you run it one more time?&#x201d; No matter how out of the question it may seem for you at this moment, you can make lots of money. Even I&#x2019;ma-buy-everyone-I-love-a-house-and-a-gold-tooth kind of money, if that&#x2019;s what turns you on.<br><br> I&#x2019;d also like to point out that there&#x2019;s nothing horribly wrong with you if you haven&#x2019;t figured out how to do it yet. Money is one of the most loaded topics out there&#x2014;we love money, hate money, obsess over money, ignore money, resent money, hoard money, crave money, bad-mouth money; money is rife with so much desire and shame and weirdness it&#x2019;s a wonder we can utter the word above a whisper, let alone go out and joyfully rake it in. (Have you been brave enough to read this book in public I wonder? With the title in full view?)<br><br> It reminds me a lot of how we&#x2019;ve been conditioned to deal with sex, another gold medalist in the Topics That Totally Freak People Out Competition. When it comes to having sex and making money, you&#x2019;re supposed to know what you&#x2019;re doing and be all great at it, but nobody teaches you anything about it, and you&#x2019;re never supposed to talk about it because it&#x2019;s inappropriate, dirty, not so classy. Both money and sex can provide unthinkable pleasures, birth new life, and inspire violence and divorce. We&#x2019;re ashamed if we don&#x2019;t have it, we&#x2019;re even more ashamed to admit we want it, we will do things/people we&#x2019;re not nuts about in order to get it, and I know I&#x2019;m not the only one who has caught myself fantasizing about a stranger dressed like Batman coming up and giving me some on a bench in Central Park (am I?).<br><br> The good news is if you, like most people, have a troubled or conflicted relationship with money, you have the ability to heal it, transform it, and become such awesome pals with money that you wake up one day to find yourself standing in the middle of the life you&#x2019;ve always wanted to live. And you can start making this change right now. All you need to do is wake up to what&#x2019;s holding you back, make new, powerful choices about what you focus on, ensmarten yourself about money, and go for it like you ain&#x2019;t never gone for it before. Which is what this book will help you do.<br><br> I personally transformed my financial reality so quickly and massively that everybody who knows me well is still wondering what the hell happened. And believe me when I say if my broke ass can do it, you can do it too, no matter how rickety or hopeless you may feel right now. Because I knew precisely zero things about making money until I was in my forties. My forties! That&#x2019;s the age when most people possess things like houses and college funds for their kids and an understanding of how the Dow Jones works. Meanwhile, at forty I possessed a barren bank account, a deep wrinkle line between my eyebrows from stress, and a first-name basis relationship with Sheila at the collection agency.<br><br> For the vast majority of my adult life I was a freelance writer, forever scrambling for work that paid an insulting nonamount considering how time consuming and challenging it was. Had I actually done the math, I would have realized just how free my lancing was, but I instead chose to be in denial of the facts, work harder, complain more, and just, you know, hope that I&#x2019;d somehow magically start raking in the dough or get run over by someone rich who would then have to take care of me for the rest of my life. My watertight plan for getting out of financial struggle was partly a result of having a whole lotta hang-ups about money (money is evil, rich people are gross, I have no idea how to make it, I&#x2019;d have no idea what to do with it even if I did know how to make it, etc.), and also because I was trapped in a perpetual state of indecision. I knew I was a writer, and I also knew I wanted to do more than sit alone in a room in my robe and type all day, I just didn&#x2019;t know what it was I wanted to do. And rather than just picking something already and seeing where it led, I chose to bite my nails down to bloody nubs and wallow in the I Don&#x2019;t Know What the Hell I Want to Do with My Life quagmire. For years. As in decades. It was so painful. And devastating. And utterly paralyzing. This is how I found myself at the ripe old age of forty, living in a converted garage, in an alley, in fear of requiring dental work, excelling at financial mediocrity in the following ways:<br> &nbsp;<br> �&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Eating/drinking/filling my pockets with anything that was free, regardless of whether or not I really liked it or needed it.<br> �&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Walking countless blocks, in flip-flops, to save five dollars on valet parking.<br> �&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Employing duct tape, instead of professionals, to repair things like leaking pipes, busted shoe straps, fractured bones.<br> �&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Meeting friends at a restaurant for dinner, ordering a glass of water, tap is fine thanks, I love the tap in this city, before explaining to the table how I&#x2019;m really not hungry, I&#x2019;m stuffed actually, and then the free bread is placed on the table and disappears into my mouth in a blur.<br> �&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Choosing between phone service and health insurance.<br> �&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Spending excruciating amounts of time purchasing anything, from a TV to a bedspread to a wooden spoon, in order to thoroughly investigate every possibility of a cheaper option, a forthcoming sale, a coupon code, or to entertain the question, &#x201c;Is this something I could perhaps make myself?&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> If I&#x2019;d put the same amount of time and focus that I put into freaking out about not having money, cutting back my expenses, finding the deals, haggling, researching, returning, refunding, redeeming, rerouting, rebating, into actually making money, I would have been driving a car with working windshield wipers years before I actually did.<br><br> This making money thing is not about never again making wise, informed purchases or rejoicing in a good sale or filling up on bread. It&#x2019;s about giving yourself the options and the permission to be, do, and have whatever lights you up, instead of acting like a victim of your circumstances. It&#x2019;s about not pretending everything is cool, I love having three roommates, none of whom know how to use a sponge or a goddamned broom, instead of focusing on making more money to afford yourself your own place for fear you&#x2019;ll be judged or you&#x2019;ll suck at it or that it&#x2019;ll be too hard or no fun or out of your reach. It&#x2019;s about creating the wealth that affords you the life you&#x2019;d love to live instead of settling for what you think you can get.<br><br> The human ability to rationalize, defend, and accept our self-imposed drama is bananas. Especially because we have all the power within us to choose and create realities that totally kick ass. We see it all the time with people who are in miserable or even abusive relationships: &#x201c;He&#x2019;s just so sad and sorry after he cheats on me. It breaks my heart. Plus, the make-up sex is superhot.&#x201d; We see it when people insist on staying in jobs they hate: &#x201c;I spend my lunch breaks weeping in the stairwell I&#x2019;m so miserable. But the health insurance is amazing.&#x201d; Meanwhile their spirit and their time on this Earth are quickly swirling down the drain.<br><br> You have one glorious and brief shot at being the you that is you on Planet Earth, and the power to create whatever reality you desire.

This collection, the best of his work over a forty-year career, features 170 duotone photographs taken between 1946 and 1988, with an emphasis on the railroad culture of the fifties and sixties. Jeff Brouws&#x2015;a railroad authority and photo historian&#x2015;has contributed a biographical essay that traces Shaughnessy's beginnings photographing steam locomotives in his hometown of Troy, New York, to his documentation of the dramatic steam-to-diesel transition, with an emphasis on the northeastern United States and Canada, where the concentration of railroad action and often deep snow resulted in beautiful and unusual images.<br><br> Not just a compendium of photographs of locomotives, this book covers the whole railroad world&#x2015;the sheds, tunnels, viaducts, yard stations, and more. It is a wonderful document of what is arguably railroading's most compelling era. 170 duotone photographs</p><p>Jeff Brouws&nbsp;is a fine art photographer and part-time writer who has nine books to his credit, authoring five on railroad photography alone. He has been published in Trains, the NRHS Bulletin and the R&amp;LHS Quarterly. A book of his own photographs, Approaching Nowhere (also from W. W. Norton) was published in 2006. His photographs can be found in major institutional collections around the country including the Whitney Museum of American Art, the Cleveland Museum of Art, Princeton University Art Museum, Harvard&#x2019;s Fogg Museum, and the Los Angeles County Museum of Art.*Starred Review* The end of railroad trains as major means of long-distance travel and short-haul shipping was foreseeable since the 1930s, as automobiles and trucks became sturdier and cheaper, paved streets and highways covered the nation, and, after World War II, wages mushroomed. Fortunately, a generation of camera-wielding young &#x201c;railfans&#x201d; artfully recorded the decline, thanks to the very cars that doomed the railroad companies. Shaughnessy began shooting trains in downtown Troy, New York (his hometown), in the middle 1940s.&nbsp;He&nbsp;eventually took lengthy trips, first in New England and Canada, later across the Midwest to the Southwest, to photograph trains. He initially focused on the big engines but quickly extended his purview to include railway workers, railway buildings, and the countrysides through which the trains rolled. A civil engineer rather than a professional photographer, he became as skilled as any pro and at least as resourceful as, say, O. Winston Link (The Last Steam Railroad in America, 1995), whose nighttime train photography Shaughnessy actually anticipated. Less theatrical than Link, Shaughnessy is an artist equally capable of achieving a shining lineation reminiscent of fine-point engraving and of rendering roiling masses of steam and smoke as charged as a running dog in a futurist painting, of dignified stillness and enveloping motion. Appearing on full pages of this oversize volume, his pictures are engrossing, stunning masterpieces of photodocumentation. --Ray Olson</p><h2>The Honey Bee and the Robber</h2><p>A new edition of the classic picture book features paper collage illustrations, full-color spreads with moving pictures, pop-ups, and pull tabs, that tell the story of a honeybee who must protect his hive against a robber bear.</p><p>Whether she's sipping nectar from beautiful flowers, avoiding hungry birds and fish, dancing with a butterfly, or bravely protecting her entire hive from a big bear with an even bigger appetite, this honeybee is always on the move.

In the years that followed, under Emperor Hirohito, conformity was the norm and the Japanese psyche became one of selfless devotion to country and emperor; soon Japanese soldiers were to engage in mass murder, rape, and even cannibalization of their enemies. Horror in the East examines how this drastic change came about. On the basis of never-before-published interviews with both the victimizers and the victimized, and drawing on never-before-revealed or long-ignored archival records, Rees discloses the full horror of the war in the Pacific, probing the supposed Japanese belief in their own racial superiority, analyzing a military that believed suicide to be more honorable than surrender, and providing what the Guardian calls &#34;a powerful, harrowing account of appalling inhumanity...impeccably researched.&#34;</p><p><b>Laurence Rees</b>, the head of historical programs for BBC Television, has been called by the Times of London "Britain's most distinguished producer of historical documentaries." The author of four previous books, he lives in London.Based on a film documentary Rees (The Nazis: A Warning from History) produced for the BBC, this chronologically organized book does a nice job of explaining the cultural attitudes and historical events that lay behind Japanese atrocities during World War II, but as a full catalogue it is incomplete. Of six chapters here, the first is devoted to political and historical background on Japan and its war with China during the 1930s, including the rape of Nanking in 1937. The second, "Dealing with the West," covers Japan's aspirations for European-held East Asian colonies (such as Indochina) that led to a U.S.-led oil embargo-and Pearl Harbor. Chapter three centers on the appalling treatment of 100,000 Allied prisoners captured after the quick fall of Singapore in 1942, while "Lurching towards Defeat" offers a view of the Pacific war 1942-1944, including the motivations of Japanese kamikaze pilots (which included "the spiritual faith that after death... their souls would dwell in the emperor's own shrine") and the rationalizations behind other Japanese atrocities. This is certainly the most valuable part of the book, although some explanations seem to go to great lengths to mitigate Japanese actions: Americans and British are unequivocally described as holding racist views in dealing with the Japanese, while "the Japanese treated the Chinese so badly" because they considered them "utterly inferior." A summary of recent academic research on Japanese emperor Hirohito's complicity is also valuable, but Rees's frequent juxtaposition of Allied crimes with those of the Japanese forces will feel apologistic to some readers, and the book does not fully recent scholarship that documents horror on a much larger scale than specifically presented here.<br>Copyright 2002 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>The Last Life: A Novel</h2><p>Narrated by a fifteen-year-old girl with a ruthless regard for truth, <i>The Last Life</i> is a beautifully told novel of lies and ghosts, love and honor. Set in colonial Algeria, and in the south of France and New England, it is the tale of the LaBasse family, whose quiet integrity is shattered by the shots from a grandfather's rifle. As their world suddenly begins to crumble, long-hidden shame emerges: a son abandoned by the family before he was even born, a mother whose identity is not what she has claimed, a father whose act of defiance brings Hotel Bellevue--the family business--to its knees. Messud skillfully and inexorably describes how the stories we tell ourselves, and the lies to which we cling, can turn on us in a moment.</p><p>Claire Messud's piercing second novel asks questions most are too fearful to face. Moving between the South of France, the East Coast of the U.S., and Algeria, <i>The Last Life</i> explores the weight of isolation and exile in one French family. Of course, the adjective <i>French</i> is already inadequate, as at least some of the LaBasses still long for the paradise lost of Algeria. And Alex LaBasse's wife, Carol, try as she might with her Continental impersonations, will always be an American sporting a metaphorical twin set. The narrator, Sagesse, too, soon finds herself equally stranded. Only her autocratic grandfather, Jacques, is ostensibly comfortable with the identity he has wrought: successful owner of the Bellevue Hotel and head of his dynasty. It is thanks to this man that 14-year-old Sagesse comes to crave invisibility. Having lost of all of her friends, she sees herself as "a member of the Witness Protection Program, surrounded by an odd human assortment chosen only for the efficiency of disguise; but somehow, nevertheless, inescapable."<p> The cause of this loss? Jacques, fed up with Sagesse and her pals' late-night noise at the hotel pool--or perhaps with their failure to take him seriously--shoots at one girl. This incident ruptures life for each LaBasse, the Bellevue no longer "their bulwark against absurdity." Looking back on the crucial two years following the patriarch's "target practice," Sagesse possesses both a teenager's slant self-interest and an older, acute eye for the mechanisms of shame. <i>The Last Life</i> is that rare thing, a fast-moving philosophical novel masquerading as a bildungsroman. In her efforts at identity and affection, its heroine is increasingly alive to the subterfuges of narrative, forcing herself to sort through versions of reality. Her grandmother, for instance, relates one myth about her husband, only to have Carol undercut it entirely. And Sagesse herself can't figure out whether Jacques is "sentimental or heartless." What if both, she realizes, are possible?</p><p> As Messud's narrator navigates her way through the past--and the Algerian sections are among the book's most extraordinary--there is everything to savor in her wavelike sentences, many of which possess a dangerously witty undertow. And the scenes of familial tedium are the opposite of tedious. The dialogue snaps with subverted emotion, anxiety, and irony. At one of the LaBasses' bleaker fests, much is made of the <i>mouna</i>, a special (if dry) Algerian cake. Nonetheless, the grandmother does her best to fob it off at evening's end. "I've never cared for it myself, although it's a lovely memory." Retrospect, as Sagesse realizes, is "a light in which we may not see more clearly, but at least have the illusion of doing so."</p><p> E.M. Forster called another Mediterranean novel, <i>The Leopard</i>, "one of the great lonely books," and it is into this category that <i>The Last Life</i> instantly falls. <i>--Kerry Fried</i></p>Claire Messud was born in the United States in 1966. She was educated at Yale and Cambridge. Her novels include <i>When the World Was Steady</i>, a finalist for the PEN/Faulkner Award in 1996, and <i>The Last Life</i>, which was widely praised and has been translated into several languages.</p><h2>Shake a Leg!</h2><p>Reading is one of the most important skills a child will ever learn.

Bridging this economic divide is New York&#x2019;s underground economy, the invisible network of illicit transactions between rich and poor that secretly weaves together the whole city.<br><br>Sudhir Venkatesh, acclaimed sociologist at Columbia University and author of <i>Gang Leader for a Day</i>, returns to the streets to connect the dots of New York&#x2019;s divergent economic worlds and crack the code of the city&#x2019;s underground economy. Based on Venkatesh&#x2019;s interviews with prostitutes and socialites, immigrants and academics, high end drug bosses and street-level dealers, <i>Floating City</i> exposes the underground as the city&#x2019;s true engine of social transformation and economic prosperity&#x2014;revealing a wholly unprecedented vision of New York.<br><br>A memoir of sociological investigation, <i>Floating City</i> draws from Venkatesh&#x2019;s decade of research within the affluent communities of Upper East Side socialites and Midtown businessmen, the drug gangs of Harlem and the sex workers of Brooklyn, the artists of Tribeca and the escort services of Hell&#x2019;s Kitchen. Venkatesh arrived in the city after his groundbreaking research in Chicago, where crime remained stubbornly local: gangs stuck to their housing projects and criminals stayed on their corners. But in <i>Floating City</i>, Venkatesh discovers that New York&#x2019;s underground economy unites instead of divides inhabitants: a vast network of &#x201c;off the books&#x201d; transactions linking the high and low worlds of the city. Venkatesh shows how dealing in drugs and sex and undocumented labor bridges the conventional divides between rich and poor, unmasking a city knit together by the invisible threads of the underground economy.<br><br>Planting himself squarely within this unexplored world, Venkatesh closely follows a dozen New Yorkers locked in the underground economy. Bangledeshi shop clerks like Manjun and Santosh navigate immense networks of illegal goods and services, connecting inquisitive tourists with sex workers and drug dealers. Hispanic prostitutes like Angela and Carla feel secure enough in the new city to leave their old neighborhoods behind in pursuit of bigger money, yet abandon all the safety they had when their clients were known locals. Rich uptown women like Analise and Brittany have the changing city at their beck and call, but both turn to sex work as an easy way to make ends meet without relying on their family fortunes. Venkatesh&#x2019;s greatest guide is Shine, an African American drug boss based in Harlem who hopes to break into the elusive, upscale cocaine market. Without connections among wealthy whites, Shine undertakes an audacious campaign of self-reinvention, leaving behind the certainties of race and class with all the drive of the greatest entrepreneurs. As Shine explains to Venkatesh, &#x201c;This is New York! We&#x2019;re like hummingbirds, man. We go flower to flower. . . . Here, you need to float.&#x201d;<br><br><i>Floating City: A Rogue Sociologist Lost and Found in New York&#x2019;s Underground Economy</i> chronicles Venkatesh&#x2019;s decade of discovery and loss in the shifting terrain of New York, where research subjects might disappear suddenly and new allies emerge by chance, where close friends might reveal themselves to be criminals of the lowest order. Propelled by Venkatesh&#x2019;s numerous interviews and firsthand research, <i>Floating City</i> at its heart is a story of one man struggling to understand a complex global city constantly in the throes of becoming.<br><br><b><i>Booklist</i><br>"Venkatesh brings to life the underground economy of New York, where rich and poor and varying ethnicities and backgrounds meet and function while they &#x201c;float.&#x201d; An enlightening book."</b><br><br><b><i>Kirkus</i><br>"Displays a piercing sense of empathy and ability to translate dry sociological principles into an understanding of the difficult lives of the urban poor...

Inside sat three extras from a John Cassavettes movie &#x2013; a young woman in lingerie and two middle-aged men with gaunt faces and greased black hair combed back over their heads. One of them had a calculator in his hand, the other played with a small rubber band. Both had unbuttoned shirts and silver chains in their chest hair. Both shot me bored looks as the half-naked girl continued with what she was saying.</p><p>&#x201c;The best thing about me, I don&#x2019;t flake out like some girls.

All three pairs of eyes focused on me.</p><p>&#x201c;I think it&#x2019;s important to just to know what people do for a living,&#x201d; I said. &#x201c;To <i>really</i> know. How much they make, how hard is it, why do they do it, who are they, things like that.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;How hard is it?&#x201d; the woman in lingerie repeated. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s hard, baby!

He realized that there was nothing traded for the Congolese goods: they had been produced by slave labour. Hochschild tells the horrific story of King Leopold&#39;s Congo and describes how Morel mobilized public opinion to combat slavery in the Belgian colony.</p><p></p><h2>The Wake: The Deadly Legacy of a Newfoundland Tsunami</h2><p><p><strong>In the vein of Erik Larson&#x2019;s <em>Isaac&#x2019;s Storm</em> and <em>Dead Wake</em> comes an incredible true story of destruction and survival in Newfoundland by one of Canada&#x2019;s best-known writers</strong></p><p>On November 18, 1929, a tsunami struck Newfoundland&#x2019;s Burin Peninsula. Giant waves, up to three storeys high, hit the coast at a hundred kilometres per hour, flooding dozens of communities and washing entire houses out to sea. The most destructive earthquake-related event in Newfoundland&#x2019;s history, the disaster killed twenty-eight people and left hundreds more homeless or destitute. It took days for the outside world to find out about the death and damage caused by the tsunami, which forever changed the lives of the inhabitants of the fishing outports along the Burin Peninsula.</p><p>Scotiabank Giller Prize&#x2013;winning writer Linden MacIntyre was born near St. Lawrence, Newfoundland, one of the villages virtually destroyed by the tsunami. By the time of his birth, the cod-fishing industry lay in ruins and the village had become a mining town. MacIntyre&#x2019;s father, lured from Cape Breton to Newfoundland by a steady salary, worked in St. Lawrence in an underground mine that was later found to be radioactive. Hundreds of miners would die; hundreds more would struggle through shortened lives profoundly compromised by lung diseases ranging from silicosis and bronchitis to cancer. As MacIntyre says, though the tsunami killed twenty-eight people in 1929, it would claim hundreds if not thousands more lives in the decades to follow. And by the time the village returned to its roots and set up as a cod fishery once again, the stocks in the Grand Banks had plummeted and St. Lawrence found itself once again on the brink of disaster.</p><p>Written in MacIntyre&#x2019;s trademark style, <em>The Wake </em>is a major new work by one of this country&#x2019;s top writers.</p><p>&nbsp;</p></p><p><p><strong>LINDEN MACINTYRE</strong> was the host of Canada&#x2019;s premiere investigative television show, <em>The Fifth</em> <em>Estate</em>, for nearly twenty-five years. Born in St. Lawrence, Newfoundland, and raised in Port Hastings, Cape Breton, he began his career in 1964 with the <em>Halifax Chronicle-Herald</em> as a parliamentary bureau reporter. MacIntyre later worked at <em>The Journal</em> and hosted CBC Radio&#x2019;s <em>Sunday Morning</em> before joining <em>The Fifth Estate</em>. His work on that show garnered an International Emmy, and he has won ten Gemini Awards. </p><p>His bestselling first novel, <em>The Long Stretch</em>, was nominated for a CBA Libris Award, while his boyhood memoir, <em>Causeway: A Passage from Innocence</em>, was a <em>Globe and Mail</em> Best Book of 2006 and won both the Edna Staebler Award for Creative Non-Fiction and the Evelyn Richardson Non-Fiction Award. His second novel, <em>The Bishop&#x2019;s Man</em>, was a #1 national bestseller and the winner of the Scotiabank Giller Prize, the Dartmouth Book Award for Fiction and the CBA Libris Fiction Book of the Year Award. His other novels include <em>Why Men Lie</em>, <em>Punishment</em> and <em>The Only Caf�</em>. MacIntyre lives in Toronto with his wife, CBC radio host and author Carol Off.

We have all made mistakes and done things we wish we had not done. We all wish we could just push a delete button on some of the choices we made yesterday and some of the things we have experienced years ago. What is more, our past has a way of shaping who we are today. It is amazing how one single dramatic experience of rejection in childhood can last through adulthood and forever alter our self image or how one bad decision in college can overshadow the dreams of the future, even God given dreams. The author knows that past hurts (whether brought on by someone else or our choice to sin) can undermine us. Raised a church kid, she knew all about sin, but made the mistakes anyway. She learned firsthand that it is not until we truly get a revelation of who we are in Christ and apply it to our lives, that our past can be erased and our dreams become real again. Terri Savelle Foy shows how we can let go of our past, change our self image and confidently move into a future with hope.<p> &nbsp;</p></p><p>Holding on to the past and all its mistakes will only hinder you from taking hold of the future that God has planned for you. But it can be so hard to let it go! That&#x2019;s why you must dream extraordinary dreams. When you focus your mind and heart on reaching your God-given goals, the past cannot hold you prisoner any longer.<br> In Make Your Dreams Bigger Than Your Memories, Terri Savelle Foy shares her personal journey out of a painful past into total freedom and walks with you, step by step, along the path to God&#x2019;s purpose for you. Your past does not define your future . . . so stop living as if it does! Turn your back on guilt, shame and regret to face the reality of God&#x2019;s love and the promise of His plans for you.&nbsp;<b>TERRI SAVELLE FOY</b> is the daughter of well-known evangelist Jerry Savelle.

Son of a teacher-poet and his demented wife, Ginsberg was accustomed from childhood to crazed and eccentric behavior. In his student days he began using drugs to widen his consciousness and systematically explore his mind. Bizarre, mystic, passionate, pacifistic, gay Beatnik activist, Ginsberg always practiced what he preached in the extreme, according to the author. Miles, a British writer, depicts the poet's soulmates and bedmates Jack Kerouac, William S. Burroughs and Peter Orlovsky, his gurus Chogyam Trungpa and Timothy Leary. Describing his world travels, mantra-chanting, meditation, musical compositions and achievements as a photographer, Miles traces Ginsberg's development into a member of the establishment--"the most famous living poet on earth," the "loudest and most influential voice" among poets of his generation.

Like most business books you will read, my writing includes original data from polling and statistical sampling that we have done, as well as through synthesizing existing publications and academic research. At Southwestern Consulting, however, while we do appreciate academic research, we pride ourselves on being practitioners, and on providing strategies that are of real value and not just a pithy pitch.</p><p>In other words, these aren&#x2019;t just principles we have gathered from a smattering of sources and that work in theory; these are principles that we are actually practicing in our own company and learning alongside you.</p><p>I cofounded Southwestern Consulting with a few other partners in 2006. Shortly thereafter, we merged with some colleagues in London who had been working toward a similar vision since 2001. Since that time, we have grown organically to more than seventy team members and we have worked with more than seven thousand different sales teams.</p><p>Our core business is providing one-on-one accountability coaching to salespeople. At the time of this writing, we have personally coached more than twenty-seven hundred salespeople, sales leaders and entrepreneurs. That means we&#x2019;ve been tracking the daily activity of how each of these people spends his or her time for six months or longer. When you work with people at such a close personal level for that amount of time, they are no longer just clients; they become friends.</p><p>And more than 75 percent of our &#x201c;friends&#x201d; say that &#x201c;time management&#x201d; is their biggest challenge and the reason they got into coaching. Because, you see, to a commission-based salesperson or an entrepreneur, time really is money, and it has become more difficult and stressful than ever before to keep up with the growing demands on our time. The most common phrase our clients use to describe their daily work challenges is that they feel like they are always &#x201c;putting out fires.&#x201d; It is a challenge that we understand because every single one of our coaches&#x2014;including me&#x2014;is a salesperson first and a consultant second.</p><p>We all sell and service our own clients. It might be more efficient and profitable for us to have some people sell and to then just hire a team of consultants to do the coaching, but then we wouldn&#x2019;t know what it feels like to be in a position like our clients&#x2019;. We wouldn&#x2019;t be practitioners. And so it is through our struggle and through all we&#x2019;ve learned from being alongside our clients that we believe we have stumbled upon some truly unique ways of thinking differently about time. We&#x2019;ve had to learn how to multiply our time, and this book is going to show you how to do the same&#x2014;regardless of what type of profession you are in.</p><p>Although one-on-one coaching is our primary service offering, we have also tested and implemented these principles in medium-sized companies and big business as well. We&#x2019;ve provided sales consulting to companies in twenty-seven countries. These clients range from small family-owned businesses to Verizon Cellular Sales and DIRECTV. We help companies build more of a sales culture by helping them create recruiting processes, custom sales scripts, incentive and compensation plans, custom sales, customer relationship management (or CRMs) and anything else they need to hire, train and motivate salespeople. Our U.S. corporate headquarters is in Nashville, Tennessee, and we have offices in London, Singapore and Sydney.</p><p>We know sales. We love sales. We believe in servant selling and we have for a long time.</p><p>Our parent company, the Southwestern family of companies, began in 1855 (back then Nashville was the southwestern part of the country, which is where our name comes from) and is one of the oldest privately held businesses in the United States. In 1868, our flagship sister company began working with college students, helping them finance their way through school by training them to sell Bibles and other books door-to-door during their summers. Over the last hundred and fifty years, the company has remained true to that core business, and still today nearly three thousand college students spend their school years building a team of friends and their summers selling a subscription-based web product called &#x201c;Southwestern Advantage,&#x201d; which supplements what kids learn in school, helps parents help their kids with homework and instills the kinds of life principles contained in my books. Working with Southwestern is one of the most challenging and rigorous opportunities a young person can become involved with&#x2014;and yet it is positively life changing.</p><p>Alumni of Southwestern include Marsha Blackburn (U.S. Congresswoman from Tennessee), Max Lucado (bestselling author), Jeff Sessions (U.S. Senator from Alabama), Rick Perry (governor of Texas), Ronnie Musgrove (governor of Mississippi), Mac Anderson (founder and former owner of Successories Inc.), Bruce Henderson (founder of Boston Consulting Group), Chinh Chu (senior managing director with the Blackstone Group), Donna Keene (former chief of staff for the Department of Education), and thousands more. Oh, and don&#x2019;t forget me&#x2014;I worked in the program for four years as a recruiter and sold door-to-door for five summers, over which I earned a combined total of about $250,000 to help pay my way through college and grad school.</p><p>The Southwestern family of companies consists of more than thirteen different business units in different industries, including the number one Raymond James financial planning office in the world, one of the fastest growing direct sales companies (Wildtree), and the largest school fund-raising company in the world (Great American). All together we have more than four million customers a year and generate several hundred million dollars in revenue.</p><p>At Southwestern, our mission is simple: to be the best organization in the world at helping people develop the skills and character they need to achieve their goals in life. So while there are many things that we do as a corporate family, the primary reason we exist is simply to help people achieve their goals in life.</p><p>Let&#x2019;s start with yours&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</p><p></p><p></p><p>Part 1</p><p>The Truth About Time</p><p></p><p></p><p>1</p><p>What You Thought You Knew</p><p>Everything you know about time management is wrong.</p><p>That is the premise we started from as we began the journey of trying to answer the question &#x201c;How do the most successful people today choose to spend their time?&#x201d;</p><p>After working with more than seven thousand different teams in twenty-seven countries and coaching more than twenty-seven hundred people one-on-one in their daily lives for six months or longer in the past eight years, our team at Southwestern Consulting has validated that premise.</p><p>Successful people think differently. And it is their thinking that shapes a different set of choices they make, which ultimately yields incredibly different results from the rest of us.</p><p>The most popular frameworks that the majority of the working world uses to understand, discuss and dissect time management have either been drastically enhanced or completely discarded by the people who most effectively <i>multiply </i>their time.</p><p>Why do these people think differently?</p><p>It&#x2019;s not because they wanted to; it&#x2019;s because they had to.</p><p>It&#x2019;s because these Multipliers<i> </i>have realized that creating the next level of results requires the next level of thinking.</p><p>It&#x2019;s because the pressure to produce results has increased, but so have the tools available to us to achieve those results.</p><p>It&#x2019;s because they know that, as it relates to the demands on our time, things have changed.</p><p>Consider a given day&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</p><p>We get up. We get ready. We run errands. We pay bills. We do housework. We cook. We eat. We clean up. And then we get ready for bed. These tasks alone can tally as much as five hours of time a day. It was reported in <i>Newsweek </i>that the average person spends one hour a day&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. looking for stuff!</p><p>When you add in the routine daily work tasks, the number of hours grows even larger. We recently did a six-month analysis of more than eight million e-mails coming into companies from a half-dozen different industries, and found that the <i>average </i>executive gets 116 e-mails every single working day.* Obviously, however, it&#x2019;s not just e-mails we have to keep up with. Voice mails. Text messages. Meetings. Conference calls. Paperwork. Reports. Social media updates. It&#x2019;s not uncommon for working professionals to spend more than three hours every day keeping up with the basic routine activities&#x2014;before we even get any real <i>work </i>done.</p><p>The result is that a new form of procrastination runs rampant. Quickly and quietly it has engulfed the workplace like a swarm of killer bees, creating a host of insidious problems:</p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;�&nbsp;Stifled innovation<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;�&nbsp;Employee turnover and burned-out human capital<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;�&nbsp;Perpetuating miscommunication<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;�&nbsp;Failing projects and missed deadlines<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;�&nbsp;Disengaged and underutilized team members<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;�&nbsp;Wasted potential and a culture of overwhelming speed, stress and anxiety<br><p>These are just a few of the destructive by-products of this phenomenon that cost organizations millions of dollars each year. Not to mention the years of an individual&#x2019;s life that are taken by the pressure that it creates.</p><p>Pervasive and powerful, this productivity killer and new form of procrastination is the most expensive invisible cost in business today&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</p><p>Priority Dilution</p><p>Unlike traditional procrastination, Priority Dilution has nothing to do with being lazy, apathetic or disengaged. Yet it is the same net result: We delay the day&#x2019;s most important activities by consciously or unconsciously allowing our attention to shift to less important tasks.</p><p>Ironically, Priority Dilution affects the top performers and the chronic overachievers, the people who are well intentioned and <i>trying </i>to do their best job. Because of their extraordinary competency, however, these people typically have more and more responsibility dumped on their plate until they eventually overload.</p><p>To someone struggling with Priority Dilution, it can sometimes feel like the harder they work, the more they fall behind. For every e-mail they send out, they get two in return. And each task they complete seems to hold behind it two more additionally that need to be done.</p><p>While they work incredibly hard, they seem to find that the Parkinson&#x2019;s Law is also true: &#x201c;The amount of busy work always expands to fill the amount of time we allow to be available.&#x201d;</p><p>Their life is often characterized as a constant state of interruption. The most common phrase they use to describe their situation is delivered with a hint of hopelessness in their voice as they plead, &#x201c;It just seems like I&#x2019;m constantly putting out fires.&#x201d;</p><p>They are spread thin. Overwhelmed. Under-rested. And they feel like they are falling further and further behind. Unsure if they can keep up with the pace that life is throwing at them, they operate under a dark cloud, sometimes desperately asking themselves in the back of their mind, &#x201c;Is this ever going to get better?&#x201d;</p><p>If it sounds like I know this person well, it&#x2019;s because I do; it&#x2019;s me.</p><p>Unlike many of my fellow writers, researchers, speakers and &#x201c;experts,&#x201d; being an author isn&#x2019;t my &#x201c;real&#x201d; job. I am an entrepreneur, a salesperson, a sales manager and an executive with a team of now more than seventy people whom I&#x2019;m trying to serve every day. And while the success of my first book, <i>Take the Stairs</i>,<i> </i>has suddenly made me into an international author, I never thought I was going to write a book on productivity.</p><p>That&#x2019;s because I never set out to solve the world&#x2019;s time-management problems; I set out to solve my own.</p><p>Let&#x2019;s start by talking about everything I <i>thought</i> I knew&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</p><p>I thought I was <i>so</i> busy</p><p>For years I had convinced myself that I was <i>so </i>busy. I would even make mini presentations to myself in my own mind about how I <i>must </i>be &#x201c;busier&#x201d; than most people around me.</p><p>I would even tell people, &#x201c;I am just <i>so</i> busy right now.&#x201d; Over and over people would ask me how I was doing and I would reply with the same melodramatic sigh that communicated just how overwhelmed I was.</p><p>It was almost as if I was allowing myself to perpetuate this story that I was so busy because it gave me some false sense of importance about myself. Sad.</p><p>Then suddenly out of the blue, one day it occurred to me that the most successful people I knew <i>never</i> complained or even spoke about how busy they were. More than that, they never even seemed to let on to anyone about everything they had going on in their lives.</p><p>These were people who were at least as &#x201c;busy&#x201d; as me, and who had more responsibilities than I did.</p><p>So I asked one of them about it once and she said, &#x201c;You reach a point where you realize how futile it is to expend energy sharing or even thinking about how &#x2018;busy&#x2019; you are. Once you get to that place, you shift to focusing that energy productively into getting the things done rather than worrying about the fact that you have to do them.&#x201d;</p><p>I noticed that they weren&#x2019;t necessarily working less than me; but they had a peace about them that I didn&#x2019;t. It was a sense of peace that resulted from their acceptance of their own situation.</p><p>What did I take from that?</p><p>Quit telling everyone how busy you are. Resist the indulgence of saying &#x201c;I am too busy.&#x201d;</p><p>Your problem is not that you are too busy; your problem is that you don&#x2019;t own your situation.</p><p>You get stressed and frustrated with distractions, fine&#x2014;we all do. But your life is your responsibility. Any commitments you have were either made or allowed by you.</p><p>It&#x2019;s not even right to complain or whine to others about how busy you are. You and I have the same amount of time in a day as Gandhi, Dr. Martin Luther King Jr., Mother Teresa, Michael Jordan or anyone else who has achieved greatness.</p><p>Once you own your problem, you empower yourself to create your own solution.</p><p>So the first step is to get over our self-indulgent complaining about how we&#x2019;re so busy or there just isn&#x2019;t enough time in a day. If you are saying those things to yourself, then you are allowing yourself to be a victim&#x2014;like I was.</p><p>You are not a victim. You are in charge. You are capable. You are powerful enough to decide what you will and won&#x2019;t do with your time.</p><p>But one thing you are no...</p></p><h2>Lolita (Popular Penguins)</h2><p>Humbert humbert is a middle-aged, fastidious college professor he also likes little girls and none more so than lolita, who he&#39;ll do anything to possess is he in love or insane? a silver-tongued poet or a pervert? a tortured soul or a monster? ...or is he all of these?</p><p>Despite its lascivious reputation, the pleasures of <i>Lolita</i> are as much intellectual as erogenous. It is a love story with the power to raise both chuckles and eyebrows. Humbert Humbert is a European intellectual adrift in America, haunted by memories of a lost adolescent love. When he meets his ideal nymphet in the shape of 12-year-old Dolores Haze, he constructs an elaborate plot to seduce her, but first he must get rid of her mother. In spite of his diabolical wit, reality proves to be more slippery than Humbert's feverish fantasies, and Lolita refuses to conform to his image of the perfect lover.<p> Playfully perverse in form as well as content, riddled with puns and literary allusions, Nabokov's 1955 novel is a hymn to the Russian-born author's delight in his adopted language. Indeed, readers who want to probe all of its allusive nooks and crannies will need to consult the annotated edition. <i>Lolita</i> is undoubtedly, brazenly erotic, but the eroticism springs less from the "frail honey-hued shoulders ... the silky supple bare back" of little Lo than it does from the wantonly gorgeous prose that Humbert uses to recount his forbidden passion: </p><blockquote> She was musical and apple-sweet ... Lola the bobby-soxer, devouring her immemorial fruit, singing through its juice ... and every movement she made, every shuffle and ripple, helped me to conceal and to improve the secret system of tactile correspondence between beast and beauty--between my gagged, bursting beast and the beauty of her dimpled body in its innocent cotton frock. </blockquote> Much has been made of <i>Lolita</i> as metaphor, perhaps because the love affair at its heart is so troubling. Humbert represents the formal, educated Old World of Europe, while Lolita is America: ripening, beautiful, but not too bright and a little vulgar. Nabokov delights in exploring the intercourse between these cultures, and the passages where Humbert describes the suburbs and strip malls and motels of postwar America are filled with both attraction and repulsion, "those restaurants where the holy spirit of Huncan Dines had descended upon the cute paper napkins and cottage-cheese-crested salads." Yet however tempting the novel's symbolism may be, its chief delight--and power--lies in the character of Humbert Humbert. He, at least as he tells it, is no seedy skulker, no twisted destroyer of innocence. Instead, Nabokov's celebrated mouthpiece is erudite and witty, even at his most depraved. Humbert can't help it--linguistic <i>jouissance</i> is as important to him as the satisfaction of his arrested libido. <i>--Simon Leake</i>Critics are just beginning to hail Jeremy Irons' performance for Random House AudioBooks...<p><b>"a road trip to hell in a luxury sedan." </b><br>--Salon Magazine</p><p><b>"In his reading Irons recreates the clarity, precision, and lilt of every glorious sentence." </b><br>--The Washington Post</p><p><b>"Nabokov said Lolita was the record of his love affair with the English language; Irons makes it a menage a trois." </b><br>-- Vogue</p><p><b>"[Irons's] efforts have placed this superb audio on my life list, to be saved for repeated listening."</b><br>--Boston Globe</p><p>" . . . most praiseworthy of all the audio efforts I've heard . . ."<br>-- Men's Journal</p><p><b>"Irons' inspired reading is not to be missed."</b><br> -- Chicago Tribune</p><p><b>"...a beautifully produced recording that pushes the boundaries of the audio medium.<br> . . . hands down the best audio production of the year." </b><br>-- Library Journal</p><p><b>"Irons reads with wickedly understated malevolence, preserving Humbert's foolish patrician airs.

Now seventy and starting to forget things, Lolly knows time is running out to reconnect with a daughter and granddaughter whose lives have become too busy for Lolly or her family stories. But when Arden, Lolly&#39;s daughter, receives an unexpected phone call about her mother, she and granddaughter Lauren rush home.

Author Margot Mifflin uncovers the subversive relationship between women and tattoo, from society ladies who want to sever their identification with &#34;natural&#34; beauty, to the healing powers that tattoo&#39;s color and symbolism can provide for a mastectomy survivor. 100 photos, some in color.</p><p><b>Margot Mifflin</b> writes about women, art, and contemporary culture.

Peter Mair&#x2019;s new book weighs the impact of these changes, which together show that, after a century of democratic aspiration, electorates are deserting the political arena. Mair examines the alarming parallel development that has seen Europe&#x2019;s political elites remodel themselves as a homogeneous professional class, withdrawing into state institutions that offer relative stability in a world of fickle voters. Meanwhile, non-democratic agencies and practices proliferate and gain credibility&#x2014;not least among them the European Union itself, an organization contributing to the depoliticization of the member states and one whose notorious &#x2018;democratic deficit&#x2019; reflects the deliberate intentions of its founders.<br> <i><br>Ruling the Void </i>offers an authoritative and chilling assessment of the prospects for popular political representation today, not only in the varied democracies of Europe but throughout the developed world.</p><p><b>Peter Mair</b> (1951&#x2013;2011) was one of the leading political scientists of his generation.

She exhibits her quilts and has won awards both nationally and internationally. Norah serves as a juror and judge for exhibits whenever possible. She lives in Santa Barbara, California.McMeeking (Bella Bella Quilts) presents quilts as vibrant as medieval cathedrals, In fact, she bases her designs on the colorful marble floors and pillars of cathedrals. In doing so, McMeeking is extending the scope of the Cosmati&#x2014;Italian designers of the Middle Ages, who harvested stones from Roman ruins and recast them to pave and decorate religious and public buildings. McMeeking, in turn, re-purposes those recycled floors as cunning templates for advanced quilt patterns. She replicates marble designs on fabric with needle-pierced duplicates and paper-foundation piecing (and also guides quilters not familiar with the method). The greatest advantage of the technique: "It is very, very accurate!" Though not for beginners, it allows for working with shapes that call for Y-seams or stamp-size pieces (the tesserae of mosaics). The book includes full-size paper-piecing patterns for nine projects on pullouts. With each set of well-illustrated instructions, McMeeking encourages quilters to "think about how you might vary this design." These stunning quilts, such as "Laterano Interlace" and "Diamante Delight," showcase McMeeking's visionary artistic expertise.

They now live not only on the coasts but in our slipstream following trawlers, barges, and garbage trucks. They are more our contemporaries than most birds, living their wild lives among us in towns and cities. In many ways they live as we do, walking the built-up world and grabbing a bite where they can. Yet this disturbs us. We&#x2019;ve started fearing gulls for getting good at being among us. We see them as scavengers, not entrepreneurs; ocean-going aliens, not refugees. They are too big for the world they have entered. Their story is our story too.&nbsp;</p> <p><em>Landfill</em> is the original and compelling story of how in the Anthropocene we have learned about the natural world, named and catalogued it, and then colonized it, planted it, or filled it with our junk. While most other birds have gone in the opposite direction, hiding away from us, some vanishing forever, gulls continue to tell us how the wild can share our world. For these reasons <em>Landfill</em> is the nature book for our times, groundbreaking and genre-bending. Without nostalgia or eulogy, it kicks beneath the littered surface of the things to discover stranger truths.&nbsp;</p></p><p><p>Tim Dee is a radio producer, television broadcaster, acclaimed author of <em>Four Fields</em> and <em>The Running Sky</em>, and editor of the anthology <em>Ground Work</em>.</p><p>&#x201c;<em>Landfill</em>&nbsp;is an erudite meditation on these former seabirds &#x2015; in literature, science and culture &#x2015; and their symbiotic relationship with us within the natural world."<strong>&#x2015;<em>Toronto Star&nbsp;</em></strong></p><br><br><p>&#x201c;<em>Landfill</em> is an important and entirely brilliant book. It&#x2019;s a love letter to gulls and their charged relationship with humans, but it&#x2019;s also a deep meditation on difficulty and waste, on the beauty of the disregarded, and on what we make of matter out of place. There&#x2019;s love and death here, fear, fascination, hope, and the breaking of the world. Dee has written an absolute triumph.&#x201d;<strong>&#x2015;Helen Macdonald, author of <em>H Is for Hawk</em></strong></p><br><br><p>&#x201c;The British literature of birds that includes Gilbert White with his swifts and martins, Helen Macdonald with her hawks, is a rich one. But Tim Dee&#x2019;s own obsession with gulls also leads him to contemplate the landfills over which they often preside and the alarming changes to our landscapes with which they are associated. His alertness to factors in ecological health results not in a jeremiad, however, but instead in an exploration of surprising parallels between evolution in the biological realm and the slow siftings of memory and culture. <em>Landfill</em> is a remarkably venturesome, robustly voiced, and illuminating book.&#x201d;<strong>&#x2015;John Elder, author of&nbsp;<em>Reading the Mountains of Home</em></strong></p><br><br><p>&#x201c;Like coyotes, ravens, raccoons, and other resourceful urban wildlife, gulls frequently face our scorn, and sometimes our bullets. In his delightful jaunt through gull taxonomy, behavior, and lore, Tim Dee casts his feathered protagonists as indomitable heroes of the Anthropocene&#x2015;thriving in our cities, colonizing our culture, and repurposing our trash as treasure. Next time a gull snatches your fries, you&#x2019;ll find yourself not cursing a petty thief, but admiring one of our planet&#x2019;s grittiest, savviest survivors.&#x201d;<strong>&#x2015;Ben Goldfarb, author of <em>Eager</em></strong></p><br><br><p>&#x201c;Tim Dee&#x2019;s restive and gorgeous prose pulls readers into the wilds of the modern urban landscape, where gulls and humans wander side-by-side with ancient poets, Victorian novelists, and Madagascar nighthawks. In this small book Dee asks&#x2015;and beautifully begins to answer&#x2015;one of the largest questions of our time: How do we live with attentive grace and wisdom alongside the varied coinhabitants of our imperiled, complex, and beloved earth?&#x201d;<strong>&#x2015;Lyanda&nbsp;Lynn&nbsp;Haupt, author of&nbsp;<em>Mozart&#x2019;s Starling</em>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<em>Crow Planet</em></strong></p><br><br><p>&#x201c;Evolution is fluid, and the urban gulls of Tim Dee&#x2019;s <em>Landfill </em>embody this ever-changing world in action. Tracking difficult-to-categorize gulls and the people who know their habits best, Dee alerts us to the heavy-laden meanings we lay on the wings of others, even as he revels the ways in which gulls continue to fly beyond our grasp. Familiarity need not breed contempt. As Dee shows, it can breed fascination.&#x201d;<strong>&#x2015;Gavin Van Horn, author of&nbsp;<em>The Way of Coyote</em></strong></p></p><h2>Interpreting the Psalms</h2><p>Interpreting the Psalms [Paperback] [Apr 01, 1986] Patrick D.

They had driven for hours across the Panhandle to get here, with the ashes in a gold-toned plastic urn on the backseat, but now nothing seemed right. They kept remembering the stories their mother had told them all their lives of her Despera Springs childhood: the monkey who died in a watermelon rind; the mysterious stranger who walked around behind a blue mule and was never seen again; the brave boy who swam across the lake in the path of light from the tower of the Chautauqua building. In a lifetime of retellings, certain phrases had settled into place like keystones: "curled up in a watermelon rind," "never seen again," and "the path of light" -- and the stories developed a lilt and cadence that made Despera Springs seem like a fairy-tale place, not an ordinary town you could find on a map and drive to on an interstate highway.</p><p>But here they were, and as far as the eye could see, there was nothing but discount stores, gas stations, used-car lots, and fast-food restaurants.</p><p>"We can't sprinkle her ashes here," said Louise. "She'd end up stuck on somebody's shoes and tracked into a nail and tan salon."</p><p>Lily was no help. She had just had her heart broken by a banjo player, and all she wanted to do was listen to the Stanley Brothers singing heartache songs and weep.</p><p>"Let's go," said Louise. "Just drive around, maybe we'll find a vacant lot, sprinkle her in some weeds, and get on home."</p><p>"Oh, your poison love has stained the lifeblood in my heart and soul, and I know my life will never be the same," Ralph Stanley sang from the tape player in a high, keening wail. Lily put the car in reverse, but the tears welled up and she backed smack into the side of a dented-in, scraped-up, painted-over Plymouth Reliant. In a terrible silence they craned their necks and watched the car door creak open and a long leg reach out, agile toes clutching on to blue shower shoes, then the whole man unfolding out of the driver's seat, tall, loose, and lanky.</p><p>"We are so sorry, sir," Louise said all in a dither, scrambling out to meet him. "My sister should not be driving a car. She just had her heart broken by a banjo player, and the tears distort her depth perception."</p><p>The man stopped and staggered back on his heels. He peered in earnestly at Lily. "Bluegrass?" he said. "Or old-time?"</p><p>"Old-time," said Lily.</p><p>"Aw, honey, bless your heart." He squatted down and gazed at her sorrowfully.</p><p>"Wait a minute," said Louise, rummaging in the glove compartment for the insurance card. "Shouldn't we be examining our cars and assessing the damage?"</p><p>"We are assessing the damage," said the man, and he stood up, took two spoons out of his pocket, and went into a little shuffling dance, tapping the spoons high up on his thigh, <i>chucka chucka chucka</i>, then down near his knee, hitting the palm of his hand on the upstroke, double time, <i>ticka ticka ticka</i>.</p><p>"I can't find any dents on your car that aren't already rusted over," called Louise.</p><p>With a little flourish he drew the spoons slowly across the inside of his knuckles and slipped them back into his pocket.</p><p>"You can trust me," he said to Lily. "I don't play nothing with strings on it."</p><p>"Can you help us find something?" said Louise. "We're looking for a lake somewhere around here, where there used to be a building with a tower."</p><p>"We're looking for the kind of place where a man might disappear behind a blue mule, or a brave boy might swim in a path of light," said Lily, "to sprinkle our mother's ashes."</p><p>"I know what you want," said the spoon player. "Come on." And he shuffled back to his car, the soles of his shower shoes slapping against his heels. Louise punched Ralph Stanley out of the tape player, and Lily drove carefully, with her eyes wide and both hands on the wheel. They followed him out of the parking lot, out onto Highway 90, past a cineplex and an industrial park. His back bumper was crumpled up and hiked up too high on one side, which gave a goofy look to the car, like a dog with one ear wrong-side out. They turned right at a light, then left at a stop sign. They passed a gun and pawn shop and an abandoned scrapyard in a pecan grove. They crossed a railroad track, then the spoon player pulled up into a little alley behind a row of dried-up-looking, old, spindly houses, long ago painted white.</p><p>"What are we doing?" said Louise. "Is this safe?"</p><p>"Stay on the risers," he said, and they followed him up rotten steps, across a toppling side porch, and out onto the front. There was a little, weedy yard, a crumbling street, then a long slope to a perfectly round lake, shining black in the afternoon sun. Across the lake in the hazy distance they could see an old building with a sagging roof and a crooked octagonal tower.</p><p>"Look, Louise," said Lily. "Go get the ashes, it's Despera Springs!"</p><p>It was the kind of sight, with the dwindling season, the dappling and the shimmering and the haze, that brings simpleminded emotions to the surface, and Louise stood at the porch railing and thought about their mother, on just such a fall day as this, a happy little girl in this town, now come back for her final rest; and Lily, with the selfishness of the brokenhearted, thought about her lost love, the banjo player, and how she would never be able to stand and look at such a sight with him.</p><p>They were both lost in these easy reveries, blinking back cheap tears, when they heard an odd ruffling sound behind them and turned around to see through the screen door an old woman sitting in a straight chair holding an ax in both hands and staring into the fireplace at a big black-and-white Muscovy duck, up to his little gnarly knees in soot and ashes.</p><p>"Grab him!" she called out. "Don't let him flap, he'll fling soot all over the house!" The spoon player grabbed the duck with both hands, backed out with him through the screen door, stretched his neck over the porch post, and one two three <i>whack</i>, the old woman chopped his head off and he flopped down into the azalea bushes.</p><p>Louise sank down on the rotten step and gazed out across the lake with her hands limp in her lap; Lily wheeled around and stared wide-eyed into the gloom of the cluttered room; and the old woman sat down heavily on the top step and grabbed Louise by the knee.</p><p>"I am exhausted," the old woman said. "I have congestive heart failure, and any little thing like that will wear me slap out."</p><p>It took them different ways. Louise, feeling a maniacal need to establish some kind of order, fell into a patter of formal good manners, introducing herself and giving a brief nonsensical synopsis of their mission here: their long drive, no place for the ashes, the spoon player, the Chautauqua building -- "and this is my younger sister, Lily."</p><p>But Lily wouldn't stop staring into the house. For some reason, with that whack and flop she had felt the banjo player lifted out of her mind for the first time in months, and images of the cluttered room rushed in to fill the unfamiliar vacancy: clumps of heavy furniture, a crumpled chandelier slouched in a corner like a giant spider, a clothes rack draped with white cotton underwear.</p><p>The spoon player finally brought them back to their senses, bouncing around the corner of the house with the duck, picked, drawn, and singed. He rinsed it at the spigot, laid it out in a black skillet, and set it down on the porch beside the old woman, who picked out one last pinfeather.</p><p>"They come up from the lake and fly down the chimney," she said to Louise, "and we eat them."</p><p>"Oh," gasped Louise. "That makes sense." And she and the old woman settled down quite companionably on the steps with the duck in its skillet and the ashes in their gold-toned urn between them, getting everything straight -- "So you are Lila Martin's girls; I had a cousin who married a Martin," the old woman said, and "That was Sid Stringer's monkey, he only loved two things, beer and watermelon," and "Yes, that's the spoon player, he keeps a lightbulb screwed in over at the Chautauqua tower, looks after us somewhat."</p><p>Behind them Lily sat on the porch floor, playing with the reflection of the Chautauqua building in her mind. When the breeze died down and the reflection in the lake grew clear and distinct, she could squint her eyes and make herself believe that the reflection was the building itself. This seemed to make anything possible, and she went on to imagine ladies in white lawn and gentlemen in bowler hats strolling in the lake yard, a drunken monkey on a red leash, a blue mule, and a mysterious stranger with a black mustache. Then a little breeze would stir up the ripples, the reflection would slur, and everything would shift back to real. Her mind would clamp down again, and there would be the banjo player on that cold, cold night, nudging her down the walkway and saying, "How could you have thought it was that important?"</p><p>"Hey," said the spoon player, looking at her through the spindles. "It's not your fault. You just let love get tangled up in your mind with a stringed instrument, that's all, easiest mistake in the world."</p><p>Lily smiled at him, the patient, weary smile of the brokenhearted. "You're sweet," she said.</p><p>"I can help you." He wiped his hands on his pants and slid the spoons out of his pocket. "I can teach you to play the spoons." He drew them slowly across his cupped palm with a little muffled cluck. "Hell, I can make you wish you <i>were</i> a spoon."</p><p>"Let's cook this duck," said the old lady, standing up and tweaking the seat of her skirt straight. "You bring him in," she said to Louise, "I'm not that strong."</p><p>"The thing is about spoons is," said the spoon player, "your ears do most of the work."</p><p>There was a clatter of pots and pans, rattling and crashing from the kitchen, and a big, sleek rat dashed through the screen door and hurtled off the edge of the porch.</p><p>"Sinking ship," said Lily.</p><p>The spoon player closed his eyes, screwed up his face, and started singing "Pretty Pol...</p></p><h2>Famous Fantastic Mysteries: 30 Great Tales of Fantasy and Horror from the Classic Pulp Magazines Famous Fantastic Mysteries &amp; Fantastic Novels</h2><p>Stories from the pulp magazines</p><p></p><h2>Knitting Fair Isle Mittens &amp; Gloves: 40 Great-Looking Designs</h2><p>Some of the 45 distinctive designs stay close to tradition; others go modern and feature a contemporary color palette.

From there she follows the flow of memory. Wilson was just 19 when she first met the 48-year-old photographer. Shortly after that first encounter, Weston jotted the following entry in one of his <i>Daybooks</i>: "I have not opened this book for almost 8 months--and with good reason; I have been too busy, busy living. I notice the last entry was 4-20. On 4-22 a new love came into my life, a most beautiful one, one which will, I believe, stand the test of time." Wilson remembers spotting a "short man in brown clothes" as she scanned a crowded room after a concert; he was Weston. Wilson soon became his model (she is the subject of more than half of his recorded nudes), then his lover, and ultimately his wife. Their relationship seemed to transcend that of artist and muse. The two worked alongside one another, she assisting him in the darkroom, he illustrating texts she wrote. <p> Wilson's memoir is filled with anecdotes about Weston's work methods and personal habits that his admirers will find delightful: Weston wore glasses to focus his shot, then yanked them off to view his subject so that each shot was achieved through a flurry of the glasses flying off and onto the photographer's face; he used a heavy tarp to transform the back of his Ford V-8 into a darkroom; he ambushed the sun, laying in the sand until it illuminated his subject just the way he desired; coated cats' whiskers with butter so they'd lick them, staying in one place long enough for him to take his shot; and had a penchant for foods that would revolt even the most iron stomached. These recollections combined with other details about their lives together, their friendships with Ansel Adams, Imogen Cunningham, Jack London and other luminaries and their work form a comprehensive if roseate view of Weston that is a substantial addition to what we know about the legendary photographer. <i>--Jordana Moskowitz</i></p>Charis Wilson&#39;s books include California and the West and The Cats of Wildcat Hill.

Written by a leading theologian and proponent of apocalyptic theology, this primer explores the impact of important recent Pauline scholarship on contemporary theology and argues for a renewed understanding of key Christian doctrines, including sin, grace, revelation, redemption, and the Christian life.</p><p>"Philip Ziegler is one of our best new-generation theologians, with a fearless proclamatory voice. His rigorous, imaginative explorations of radical biblical theology are particularly valuable in an era when romanticized spirituality seems to be displacing the church's apostolic confession. This book will be tremendously rewarding as a resource for those seeking to be refreshed in their confidence in the essential integrity of the Word of God."<br>--<b>Fleming Rutledge</b>, author of <i>The Crucifixion: Understanding the Death of Jesus Christ</i><br><br>"Working at the creative interface between biblical studies and systematic theology, Ziegler brilliantly develops the apocalyptic turn in Pauline scholarship into a rich theological program. On this profound reading, Paul's gospel speaks directly and boldly to the delusions and fears of a world in crisis."<br>--<b>John M.&nbsp;G. Barclay</b>, Durham University<br><br>"Anyone who believes that Christian doctrine cannot be grounded in an apocalyptic perspective needs to read <i>Militant Grace</i>. With his typical breadth of knowledge, clarity, and insightful observations, Ziegler shows that apocalyptic can inform Christians' thinking about salvation and grace, ethics and discipleship. This book demonstrates that apocalyptic is not a fad but an essential aspect of interpreting the Bible and thinking theologically."<br>--<b>Nancy&nbsp;J. Duff</b>, Princeton Theological Seminary<br><br>"In attending to the apocalyptic dimensions of the gospel message, Ziegler addresses a theme of central contemporary import in both biblical studies and systematic theology. With characteristic acuity and insight, Ziegler draws the reader into the extraordinary vision of Paul's evangelical witness and thence leads the reader to consider what this might mean for the work of the Christian theologian--not only academically but also existentially. Treating a range of substantive doctrinal themes and drawing on an array of significant Protestant theologians, Ziegler in turn exposits, analyzes, reflects, and instructs.

When a body is discovered in the Lincoln Bedroom while the conferees are still in session, Eleanor Roosevelt knows that in order to keep the murder (as well as the Conference) a secret from the prying eyes of the press, not to mention foreign agents, she must solve it herself. <br><br>Eleanor soon learns that the victim, Paul Weyrich, was a White House employee-one of the President's top advisors-who had been having an affair with his secretary. At first glance, it looks to be a crime of passion, instigated by Mr. Weyrich's refusal to marry his secretary. However, the deeper Eleanor digs into the case, the more clouded and uncertain the investigation becomes. Gradually, Eleanor discovers that the victim was part of a plot to assassinate the President, and she embarks on a daring plan to trap the assassin, using FDR as bait. Eleanor's skills will be put to the ultimate test as she must race to solve the mystery before the assassin strikes again. <br><br>As the intrepid and charming Mrs. Roosevelt engages in her latest bit of Hawkshawing, readers are treated to all the historical re-creation and rich storytelling that have become hallmarks of the series. This satisfying wartime whodunit starring America's First Lady of Mystery is a warmly rewarding look at a fascinating era, and at a woman beloved by her family and her country-Eleanor Roosevelt. <br></p><p>Elliott Roosevelt (shown here with his wife, Patty), son of Franklin and Eleanor, was a former writer and rancher. He died in 1990 but left behind a number of unpublished manuscripts to be enjoyed by readers in the years to come.<br>Once again, Eleanor Roosevelt calmly juggles her official duties as First Lady with her unofficial role as amateur sleuth in this unpretentious, undemanding offering attributed to her late son Elliott, who according to St. Martin's left behind a number of unpublished manuscripts when he died. When lawyer Paul Weyrich, special White House counsel, turns up dead in the Lincoln Bedroom with an unauthorized gun in his suit jacket, Mrs. Roosevelt takes on the case, aided by old friend D.C. police captain Ed Kennelly. Since FDR is busy hosting the secret Trident Conference to plot the liberation of Europe with guests Prime Minister Churchill and General Eisenhower, it's vitally important that nothing disturb their deliberations. In between interviewing Weyrich's "Government Girl" girlfriend and other suspects, the First Lady mingles with such celebrities of the day as Danny Kaye and Jack Benny. In a sly touch, the author is himself the subject of a Hollywood tale told by Humphrey Bogart that reflects on the young man's discretion. ("Elliott has not invariably used good judgment," comments the First Lady.) While the villains behind the murder soon become obvious, the victim's method of smuggling a gun inside the executive mansion is quite ingenious. And if in the end the motivation for the murder is weak, it really doesn't matter, for it's the sympathetic portrayal of the people in the Roosevelt White House that ultimately counts in this unique series.

Lusa Maluf Landowski finds herself unexpectedly marooned on her husband&#39;s farm where she must declare or lose her attachment to the land. Garnett Walker and Nannie Rawley, a pair of elderly, feuding neighbours, tend their respective farms and wrangle about God, pesticides, and the possibilities of a future neither of them expected. Over the course of one humid summer in the Appalachian mountains these characters discover their connections to one another and to the flora and fauna with which they share their place in the world.</p><p>There is no one in contemporary literature quite like Barbara Kingsolver. Her dialogue sparkles with sassy wit and earthy poetry; her descriptions are rooted in daily life but are also on familiar terms with the eternal. With <i>Prodigal Summer</i>, she returns from the Congo to a "wrinkle on the map that lies between farms and wildness." And there, in an isolated pocket of southern Appalachia, she recounts not one but three intricate stories. <p> Exuberant, lush, riotous--the summer of the novel is "the season of extravagant procreation" in which bullfrogs carelessly lay their jellied masses of eggs in the grass, "apparently confident that their tadpoles would be able to swim through the lawn like little sperms," and in which a woman may learn to "tell time with her skin." It is also the summer in which a family of coyotes moves into the mountains above Zebulon Valley: </p><blockquote> The ghost of a creature long extinct was coming in on silent footprints, returning to the place it had once held in the complex anatomy of this forest like a beating heart returned to its body. This is what she believed she would see, if she watched, at this magical juncture: a restoration. </blockquote> The "she" is Deanna Wolfe, a wildlife biologist observing the coyotes from her isolated aerie--isolated, that is, until the arrival of a young hunter who makes her even more aware of the truth that humans are only an infinitesimal portion in the ecological balance. This truth forms the axis around which the other two narratives revolve: the story of a city girl, entomologist, and new widow and her efforts to find a place for herself; and the story of Garnett Walker and Nannie Rawley, who seem bent on thrashing out the countless intimate lessons of biology as only an irascible traditional farmer and a devotee of organic agriculture can. As Nannie lectures Garnett, "Everything alive is connected to every other by fine, invisible threads. Things you don't see can help you plenty, and things you try to control will often rear back and bite you, and that's the moral of the story." <p> Structurally, that gossamer web <i>is</i> the story: images, phrases, and events link the narratives, and these echoes are rarely obvious, always serendipitous. Kingsolver is one of those authors for whom the terrifying elegance of nature is both aesthetic wonder and source of a fierce and abiding moral vision. She may have inherited Thoreau's mantle, but she piles up riches of her own making, blending her extravagant narrative gift with benevolent concise humor. She treads the line between the sentimental and the glorious like nobody else in American literature. <i>--Kelly Flynn</i></p><p>Barbara Kingsolver's fifth novel is a hymn to wildness that celebrates the prodigal spirit of human nature, and of nature itself. It weaves together three stories of human love within a larger tapestry of lives amid the mountains and farms of southern Appalachia. Over the course of one humid summer, this novel's intriguing protagonists face disparate predicaments but find connections to one another and to the flora and fauna with which they necessarily share a place.</p></p><h2>The Lake</h2><p>The Lake is the history of an obsession. It traces a man's sad pursuit of an unattainable perfection, a beauty out of reach, admired from a distance, unconsummated. Homeless, a fugitive from an ambiguous crime, his is an incurable longing that drives him to shadow nameless women in the street and hide in ditches as they pass above him, beautiful and aloof. For their beauty is not of this world, but of a dream--the voice of a girl he meets in a Turkish bath is "an angel's," the figures of two students he follows seem to "glide over the green grass that hid their knees." Reality is the durable ugliness that is his constant companion and is symbolized in the grotesque deformity of the hero's feet. And it is the irreconcilable nature of these worlds that explains the strangely dehumanized, shadowy quality of the eroticism that pervades this novel. <p>In a sense The Lake is a formless novel, a "happening," making it one of the most modern of all Kawabata's works. Just as the hero's interest might be caught by some passing stranger, so the course of the novel swerves abruptly from present to past, memory shades into hallucination, dreams break suddenly into daylight. It is an extraordinary performance of free association, made all the more astonishing for the skill with which these fragments are resolved within the completed tapestry.</p></p><p>Yasunari Kawabata was born in 1899. He described himself as a child "without home or family" and became, in the novelist Mishima's words, "a perpetual traveler." He lost his parents in infancy, his grandmother and only sister died shortly afterward, and he was fourteen when his grandfather died. From the following year he lived in a middle-school dormitory, and in 1917 he left his native Osaka to join the First High School in Tokyo. <p>His earliest known work, a diary he kept at the age of fourteen about the last few weeks before his grandfather's death, is disturbing for someone so young and reflects the same cold pathos that marks his later fiction. His reputation, however, was not really made until the publication of a short novel in 1927, The Izu Dancer, which describes a brief encounter between a high-school student and the child dancer of the title. </p><p>Probably his best-known work, Snow Country, was completed in 1947 and deals with an affair between a Tokyo dilettante and a hotspring geisha; its evocation of the loneliness and sadness of life has served, more than any other of his novels, to establish the Kawabata image. The Lake itself belongs to his most productive decade following the end of World War II and was first serialized in 1954, along with two other major works, The Master of Go and The Sound of the Mountain. His last two novels, House of the Sleeping Beauties and The Old Capital, were both published in the early sixties, the former being a memorable story of an old man who spends four nights in a brothel with young girls drugged into a sleep from which they cannot be awakened. Kawabata was made the first Japanese Nobel laureate for literature in 1968, and committed suicide alone in his apartment near the sea in 1972. </p><p>The Translator: Reiko Tsukimura, Professor Emeritus at the University of Toronto, was born in Tokyo and studied at Japan Women's University. She received a Ph.D. in comparative literature from Indiana University and has held academic positions at the University of British Columbia, Harvard University, the University of Minnesota, and the University of Toronto, where she taught for twenty-one years. Now retired, she continues to conduct research on Japanese literature and Buddhism, and to lecture on haiku in the Continuing Studies Program, University of Victoria, while enjoying her hobbies of year-round gardening, hiking, and painting. </p><p>Her many articles in English and Japanese deal with the dynamic interplay between Japanese and Western culture and between tradition and modernity. She has translated, among other works, I Am Alive: The Tanka Poems of Goto Miyoko, 1898-1978 (1988) and Sengai: Master Zen Painter. She also edited, and wrote the introduction for, Life, Death and Age in Modern Japanese Fiction (1978).</p>The following evening Gimpei felt compelled to see the girl again on the slope lined with ginkgo trees. She had been almost undisturbed by his pursuit; how could he possibly harm her, Gimpei thought to himself sorrowfully. It was like grieving after the flight of a wild goose through the sky ... or watching the shining stream of time flow past. His own life might end tomorrow, and even the girl would not be beautiful forever. <p>But since Gimpei had made himself known to the student by talking with him the previous day, he couldn't loiter on the slope under the ginkgo trees, nor could he stay on the bank where the boy would be waiting for her. He decided to hide in the ditch between the tree-lined sidewalk and the aristocrat's mansion. If he were questioned by a policeman he could say that his legs hurt and that he was drunk and had fallen in the ditch, or that he had been thrown into it by a hoodlum. As drunkenness seemed the safer explanation, Gimpei had one drink before leaving home to make his breath smell of liquor. </p><p>Gimpei had seen the ditch the day before and thought it was deep, but when he got in he found it was wide but quite shallow, with both sides lined with good solid walls and the bottom also paved with stone. Grass grew in the crevices between the stones, and last year's decaying leaves lay matted on the floor. If he pressed himself close against the wall on the side of the road he wouldn't be seen by passers-by coming up the straight slope. He hid there for twenty or thirty minutes, conscious of a desire to gnaw at one of the stones in the wall. He noticed a violet flowering between the stones and, creeping closer, he opened his mouth, bit it off with his teeth and swallowed it. It was difficult to swallow, and with a moan Gimpei struggled to hold back his tears. </p><p>The girl appeared at the foot of the slope with her dog. Spreading out his arms and gripping the edges of the stones, Gimpei gradually raised his head. He felt that the wall was about to crumble; his hands were trembling and his heart thumped against the stones. The girl was in the white sweater she had worn the day before, but she was wearing a dark red skirt instead of jeans and her shoes were better too. The white and ruby colors approached, floating amid the fresh green trees. When she passed just above Gimpei's head her hand was in front of his eyes. The skin was fair, and on her arm more delicate still. Staring up at her lovely chin, Gimpei closed his eyes with a cry of admiration.</p></p><h2>Somebody&#39;s Someone: A Memoir</h2><p>What happens to a child when her own parents reject her and sit idly by as others abuse her? In this poignant, heart wrenching debut work, Regina Louise recounts her childhood search for someone to feel connected to. A mother she has never known--but long fantasized about-- deposited her and her half sister at the same group home that she herself fled years before. When another resident beats Regina so badly that she can barely move, she knows that she must leave this terrible place-the only home she knows. Thus begins Regina&#39;s fight to survive, utterly alone at the age of 10. A stint living with her mother and her abusive boyfriend is followed by a stay with her father&#39;s lily white wife and daughters, who ignore her before turning to abuse and ultimately kicking her out of the house. Regina then tries everything in her search for someone to care for her and to care about, from taking herself to jail to escaping countless foster homes to be near her beloved counselor. Written in her distinctive and unique voice, Regina&#39;s story offers an in-depth look at the life of a child who no one wanted. From her initial flight to her eventual discovery of love, your heart will go out to Regina&#39;s younger self, and you&#39;ll cheer her on as she struggles to be Somebody&#39;s Someone.</p><p>Regina Louise lives in Berkeley, California.This straightforward, sincere story of a neglected child who tries to fulfill her wish-to be a "wanted and special child"-opens when Louise is 11. She's lived in a chaotic, violent foster home for as long as she can remember. After a brutal beating with a garden hose, she runs away to her well-meaning but ineffectual grandmother. From there, she pinballs from one relative or foster parent to another, all of whom treat her with indifference if not abuse. She ends up, at 13, at an Illinois shelter whose sheer normality (i.e., no beatings, and friendly people who teach her to swim and do macram&#x201a;) allows her finally to relax a little. Unfortunately, it's a temporary situation, and Louise's anxiety over leaving a safe place makes her behave badly. The author, who's now a hair stylist and owns two Bay Area salons, brilliantly portrays how what seems like "in-cur-ridge-abul" to adults feels like simple self-defense to a child scarred by maltreatment. When one shelter worker finally gives her unequivocal love, it turns her life around. If this were fiction, it might seem overly maudlin; its poignancy lies in being a true story. The narrator's vernacular voice ("When I did ask somebody about the... reason my mama left... everybody got deaf and dumb all a sudden....") can sometimes make for bumpy reading. But this rare look into the inner world of an unwanted child will enlighten readers concerned with the fate of at-risk children.<br>Copyright 2003 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Angel: After the Fall, Vol. 3</h2><p><ul> <li>The main <i>After The Fall </i>storyline is back in the crosshairs in this third hardcover volume of the latest <i>Angel </i>series!

He has served as a missionary in Mexico, the Philippines, and Senegal, West Africa, with Youth With A Mission (YWAM), The Luke Society, and Philippine Health Care Ministries. Since 2001, he has directed Dental Training For Missions. Gerry trains missionaries in primary dental care. He and his wife, Denise, (of 30 years), have three daughters and six grandchildren. What qualifies Gerry to write on this theme? � For many years he has intensively reflected on the works of others and studied the Scriptures on this theme. He has found solid Biblical evidence for his conclusion of hope. � He has agonized for most of his life over hell and understands the contradictions it creates within the Christian faith and the Scriptures. Gerry asked himself and God, &#x201c;Who am I to write such a book?&#x201d; Then he recalled 1Cor. 1:26-29, &#x201c;...God hath chosen the foolish things of the world to confound the wise...that no flesh should glory in his presence.&#x201d; KJV. This, with Mt. 10:27 and 11:25, spurred him on. &#x201c;Knowing Gerry as a close friend, I can say that he has wrestled with God and his conscience over the issues presented in this book. Hope Beyond Hell is the result of many years of introspection, Bible study, and prayer. Gerry's enthusiasm for what he has discovered is evident on every page.

So I went to him.<br><br> Frosty was a big dog, a yellow Lab, gentle and friendly and smart enough to recognize something unusual in my voice, something that told him this wasn't going to be a normal walk.<br><br> I made a grab for his collar. Frosty tucked his head down against his shoulder so I couldn't attach the leash. Up close, I smelled the rich scent of his fur, felt his hot breath against my hand.<br><br> "Frosty, no."<br><br> My frustration grew, and I gritted my teeth, felt the molars grind against one another in the back of my mouth. Frosty ducked even more. Without thinking, I brought my free hand up and gave him a little swat on the snout. He surprised me by yelping, and I immediately felt like a jerk, an indefensible son of a bitch. I'd never hit him before, not even during training.<br><br> He cowered even more, but when I reached out again, he lifted his head, allowing me to attach the leash to his collar.<br><br> I straightened up, took a deep breath.

She raised her hand and placed it against her chest.<br><br> "Isn't that what you want? You've been after me to do it for almost a year."<br><br> "Yes, I do want that," she said. "I thought you didn't."<br><br> Frosty sat at my feet, head down. Defeated. The refrigerator cycled, made a low humming noise and then shut off. I shrugged.<br><br> "You keep saying we have to move on with our lives. Right? Turn the page?"<br><br> She nodded, a little uncertain. Over the past couple of years, Abby's face had rarely shown uncertainty. Her involvement with the church made her seem certain all the time, as though nothing were ever in doubt. Except for me. I knew she harbored doubts about me. As a last resort, I was sacrificing the dog. A show of good faith on my part. But I didn't think she'd let me go through with it. I thought once she saw Frosty on his leash, ready to be led out the door and to the pound, she'd stop me.<br><br> Tears stood in her eyes, and she took a deep breath.<br><br> "I think we do need to do that, Tom." She sighed. "With the memorial service coming up, I think we can move on." She sighed again, and it sounded more like a hiccup, almost a cry. "I used to love Frosty, but every time I look at him now, I think of Caitlin. And I can't. I don't want to do it anymore."<br><br> "You're sure, Abby? Really? He's such a good dog."<br><br> She shook her head, tapped her foot against the floor. "I'm sure, Tom."<br><br> "Fine." I tugged the leash, harder than I needed to, and Frosty jerked to his feet. His paws clattered against the floor, slow and methodical. Dead dog walking. "Will you be here when I get back?"<br><br> "I have a meeting at church."<br><br> I nodded, my hand on the doorknob of the back door.<br><br> "It's funny," I said.<br><br> "What is, Tom? What's funny?"<br><br> "You say you can't stand to see Frosty because he reminds you of Caitlin. I love having Frosty around for the same reason."<br><br> "Tom. Don't."<br><br> "I won't." I opened the door and stepped outside, leading the only known witness to my daughter's abduction to his demise.<br><br> I didn�t go straight to the pound. My guilt got the better of me-guilt over Frosty�s impending doom, guilt over the slap on the nose, guilt over who knows how many things-so I drove a short distance and stopped at the park. When I pulled into the lot, Frosty perked up. His ears rose, his tail thumped against the backseat, and he started panting, filling the enclosed car with his musky dog breath. I found a spot in the shade and climbed out, then opened the back door for Frosty. He jumped down, nose to the ground, sniffing every square inch he came across, stopping only to pee against a small tree. I took that opportunity to attach the leash again and let Frosty lead me through the park.<br><br> Since it was a Saturday and late summer, the park was full of activity. At the baseball diamond near the road, a boys' team practiced, their aluminum bats pinging with every contact. Joggers and speed walkers traced the running track, and I followed along in their wakes, letting Frosty pull me off to the side every ten feet while he inspected a fallen branch or a curious scent. I tried to tell myself I was there for the dog, that he deserved to spend his final moments on this earth doing the things he loved the most: romping through the park, chasing butterflies, or charging after squirrels. But it was a lie. Caitlin had disappeared from that park four years ago, while walking Frosty, and I found myself returning there, alone, again and again.<br><br> The park occupied nearly two hundred acres just two blocks from our house. To the east and south, new subdivisions with streets named after variations on deer-Running Fawn, Leaping Hart-dotted the landscape. The bricks of the houses were new and gleaming, the streets smooth and unstained. As we walked, Frosty continued to huff at the end of his leash, his tail bobbing like a metronome. Forgiveness came quickly to him. My earlier transgression was apparently forgotten, and I didn't have time to think about it anyway. I knew that Frosty was leading me toward the edge of the park where it bordered Oak Ridge, the oldest operational cemetery inside the town's limits and the site of Caitlin's upcoming memorial service and "burial," which was scheduled for later in the week.<br><br> The neat rows of headstones and cleanly cropped grass came into view. I must have slowed, because Frosty turned his head back to look at me, one eyebrow cocked. I hadn't been to the park or the cemetery in the weeks since Abby decided to hold the memorial service and place a headstone in Caitlin's honor. She had been receiving "counseling" from the pastor of her church-Pastor Chris-and he apparently felt that four years was enough time to grieve for a lost child. He'd managed to convince Abby it was time to move on.<br><br> I used to take some measure of comfort from cemeteries, even after Caitlin disappeared. They assured me that even death could be beautiful, that even after we are gone, some memory, some monument to our lives could still exist and endure.<br><br> My cell phone buzzed in my pocket.<br><br> I jumped a little when the vibration started. Frosty turned his head around, his tongue hanging out of his mouth.<br><br> I dug the phone out of my pocket, expecting it to be Abby checking in. I might have ignored it if it had been her, but the caller ID told a different story. It was my brother. Actually, my half brother, Buster. His given name is William, but he acquired his nickname as a child when he managed to break everything he touched.<br><br> I answered just before voice mail kicked in.<br><br> "What's up, boss?" he asked.<br><br> His voice possessed its usual hail-fellow-well-met cheer. Talking to him on the phone was like conversing with a particularly convincing telemarketer, one who could almost make you believe your ship had come in and you'd be a fool to pass up the current offer. Buster maintained this tone even though we hadn't spoken to each other in close to six months. He'd moved an hour away the year before, and our communication, which had always been sporadic, slowed to a drip. We shared a mother-dead five years earlier-but had different fathers. My dad died when I was four. My mom remarried and had Buster.<br><br> I told him I was walking the dog.<br><br> "Good, good." He cleared his throat. I heard someone talk in the background on his end of the line. It sounded like a woman. "I wanted to tell you I'm coming to town this week."<br><br> "What for?"<br><br> "For the funeral," he said. "Or whatever the hell it is that Abby's doing. I know you didn't invite me, and you might not even want me to come, but Abby called. She said she wanted all of the family there, and since you don't have much-I mean, I'm pretty much it these days. Right?"<br><br> "It's not that I didn't want you to come," I said. Frosty and I stood alongside the cemetery and I could see the area where Caitlin's marker would go up in a few days. "I just thought you wouldn't want to come because-"<br><br> "Because it's so fucked-up."<br><br> I hesitated. "Yeah, because of that."<br><br> "What's she going to do, bury an empty coffin? How do you have a funeral for someone who might not be dead?"<br><br> "We didn't buy a coffin."<br><br> "But you bought a plot and a headstone?"<br><br> Frosty tugged on the leash, indicating he wanted to move on.<br><br> "Yeah," I said.<br><br> "Jesus. Is this because of that wackadoodle church she belongs to? What's it called?"<br><br> I regretted ever answering the phone. "Christ's Community Church."<br><br> "That's original," he said. "Aren't they all Christ's churches? Remember when people belonged to actual churches? You know, Baptists, Methodists, Presbyterians. I hate hearing about these anything-goes religions, you know? Just put up a warehouse and a coffee bar and let them come in and feel good about themselves."<br><br> "I didn't know you were so easily offended."<br><br> "Stupidity pisses me off. That herd mentality. How much is it costing you to buy this cenotaph and plot? A couple thousand bucks?"<br><br> Frosty pulled against the leash again, and I tugged back, trying to keep him still.<br><br> "Buy what?" I asked.<br><br> "A cenotaph. That's what they call it when you put up a marker and there's no body under it. A cenotaph. You're not the only one who knows the big words, professor."<br><br> "Look, I have to go. The dog's done his business."<br><br> "I'll call you when I get to town. Okay?"<br><br> "Sure. But don't feel obligated-"<br><br> "I do feel obligated," he said. His voice dripped with sincerity, and I wanted to believe him. I really did. "For you, anything. Just let me know. I'll be by your side." <br><br> Frosty and I faced the choice of going around the track again, something we almost never did, or getting in the car and completing my mission. Frosty pulled a little in the direction of the car, but I pulled harder, and we entered the cemetery together.<br><br> I knew they didn't want pets in there, digging up flowers and shitting and pissing on the graves. But Frosty's tank was pretty well emptied, and I preferred to face the prospect of an accident in the cemetery over delivering him to the pound.<br><br> We walked down the road that cut through the center of the cemetery, then turned right and headed toward the back. I recognized the names on the larger headstones, the same names that adorned the buildings and parks throughout town. Potter. Hardcastle. Greenwood. Cooper. They didn't skimp on death, these founding families and innovative educators, these city councilmen and spiritual leaders. Not only did they have elaborate headstones, beautifully engraved and clean as the day they were cut, but they paid for life-sized guardians to watch over the graves. Vigilant Virgin Marys and winged angels, Christ with his eyes cast to heaven as though begging for intercession. While the stone we'd picked out for Caitlin didn't approach those lofty heights, it wasn't cheap either. Buster was right-we'd spent too much money.<br><br> I read the signs posted at knee level and found section B; then I worked my way up until I came to the number. Despite the presence of the sleeping and buried dead, it was a beautiful day. The temperature climbed toward eighty, and only a few high, puffy clouds disrupted the blue of the sky. In the distance, somewhere, a lawn mower engine churned, but I couldn't see where it was, and when I looked around the cemetery, I found myself alone. The walkers and joggers kept up their work in the park, so I just listened to Frosty's panting breath and rattling collar.<br><br> "It's just a little detour, boy."<br><br> Most of the cemetery was full, the stones nestled close together so that it didn't appear there was any room left for new burials. I kept my eyes peeled for a small open place, a last remaining plot that we purchased only to-hopefully-never fill. My eyes wandered over husbands buried with their wives, the headstones a monument to eternal love and union. I saw children buried near their parents. Veterans of wars, their stones decorated with small, fluttering flags. And then I thought I saw Caitlin's name.<br><br> It was a brief glimpse, something caught out of the corner of my eye, and I just as quickly dismissed it, assuming that my eyes and mind, in their haste to find a closer connection to my daughter, simply imagined her name. But as I came closer, I saw it again, chiseled into a large rectangular headstone. It was really there. caitlin ann stuart. daughter. friend. angel. 1992-2004.<br><br> The stone didn't belong there.<br><br> Abby had told me it wouldn't be placed until days after the service, that when we stood at the grave on Wednesday for the memorial, we'd just be facing a small area of green grass. No earth would be churned, no stone in place. And I took comfort in that scenario because it seemed less permanent somehow, less final than what Abby had intended. I convinced myself that the ceremony would bear no real relation to my daughter, that we were there remembering some other kid or maybe even some person I never knew. A stranger, the faceless, nameless victim of a distant tragedy.</p><h2>Prayers from the Ark</h2><p>Discovered in a convent kitchen forty-five years ago, a collection of prayers written in verse gives voice to the various animals aboard Noah&#39;s Ark.</p><p>Text: English (translation)<br> Original Language: FrenchGrade 3 Up-- It would be a great pity if this book's title relegated it to religious sections only. These ``prayers'' of a selection of animals are poetic reflections on their natures, their functions, and their fates. Each creature is vividly self-characterized, wittily and concisely; at the same time, each unmistakably mirrors human feelings and foibles. The patient, plodding ox; the self-important cock; the awkwardly bulky elephant; the haughty cat--all pray in a way that reveals their essential weaknesses and strengths. Noah's opening prayer is plangent and universal, but it takes on an extra dimension for careful readers who infer the circumstances of its composition during World War II (only the briefest introduction is provided). Although these poems were first translated in 1962, the selections here will bring them to a new generation. Moser contributes a brilliant portrait of every animal, subtly suggesting the very qualities revealed in each one's words. These splendid illustrations exactly suit the wide range of the text, drawing younger readers in without condescension, but satisfying even the most sophisticated. Few readers will be immune to the power of this book, or fail to hear an interior echo in these pleas for freedom, dignity, understanding, and grace. --Patricia Dooley, Univ . of Washington, Seattle<br>Copyright 1992 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>The Arts and Crafts of Swat Valley: Living Traditions in the Hindukush (Arts &amp; Crafts)</h2><p>The upper Swat valley in the mountain region of north Pakistan, not well known even to those with a special interest in the Orient, has one of the most remarkable cultures in the Islamic world, influenced by the cultures of central Asia, China and India.</p><p>This book focuses on the powerful architecture and distinctive decorative tradition of the Swat Valley.

Stripping away the hype surrounding such cases as the Menendez brothers, Baby Jessica, and Susan Smith&#39;s murder of her children, Hodgson reveals America&#39;s self-deception about children&#39;s realities, and shows that the more we focus on individual cases of deviation, the more we overlook the systemic causes of the problem.</p><p>While many in their later years are fond of reciting "Youth is wasted on the young," author Lucia Hodgson would argue that the saying rings true only if you long for physical and emotional abuse, economic injustice, sexual exploitation and frightening vulnerability. It is those elements, and not some nostalgic view of childhood and adolescence, which make up Hodgson's view of child rearing. Readers who consider themselves to be good parents will find themselves disagreeing with Hodgson on virtually every page, though will be unable to deny that her arguments are thought-provoking. "Most parents want to determine what kind of people their children will become," she writes in the first chapter. "They have children, in part, to mold them, to dictate their religion, their sexual orientation, their professional aspirations, and their cultural predilections. . . Our culture resists empowering children with rights, not only because it would allow them to challenge arbitrary and unjust parental control, but also because it would make it less likely that they would turn out the way their parents wish." Hodgson, the director of a California youth studies center, is most on target in this book with her analysis of child custody and abuse cases which have captured the public's interest and been the fodder for headlines; the Menendez brothers, Amy Fisher, Susan Smith's murder of her children and the Baby Jessica case. In her examination of these domestic nightmares she uses credible arguments to damn the adults involved, and shows that in most every instance the outcome was not in the best interests of the children. While reporters and broadcasters brought these horrors into our living rooms, Hodgson has the courage to hold up a mirror to the faces of all parents, forcing us to examine our own families. Her critique of corporate giants like McDonalds also hits its mark. Where Raised in Captivity misses is in its attempt to show that parenting, as an institution, is severely flawed and needs to be overhauled. She advocates giving decision-making rights to children before they are aware enough of the workings of the world to make safe and informed choices. Thousands of parents have children because they want to live their lives within a family; because they enjoy the company of children; because they have joy in their hearts and want to share it. These people do not have a place in Hodgson's book. -- <i>From Independent Publisher</i>America, which considers itself a child-centered society, is, according to Hodgson, anything but. The author, director of a children's study center in Santa Monica, Calif., and a consultant to the Harvard Project on Schooling and Children, uses recent high-profile cases like the Menendez brothers' murder of their parents and Susan Smith's murder of her two children to illuminate how Americans both misread and misdirect their concerns about children's conditions in this society. In chapter after chapter, she lifts rocks from the latest trends in politics, economics, and social theory to reveal a scurrying nest of notions that give priority to powerful adults rather than needy children. For instance, she raises a deceptively simple question regarding the hotly contested issue of children's legal rights: If giving children more standing regarding their home life and upbringing will find them leaving home in droves, as some conservatives have argued, then might there not be something wrong with the homes? In another chapter, she suggests that children are not always better off with their biological parents. The ``nearly unconditional parental power'' over children shows a society, she asserts, deliberately blind to the fact that most known child abuse occurs within the home and not at the hands of fearsome strangers. Moreover, Hodgson points out that even though we know now that sexual abuse of children is far more widespread than previously believed, the testimony of children about their abuse is regarded as highly suspect. She also fingers poverty as a more likely culprit than moral decay in the so-called breakdown of the family. It is, she concludes, ``terrifying, difficult and dangerous to be a child in this society.'' No quick fixes suggested here, but a thought-provoking, well-argued examination of the hypocrisy that surrounds America's view of its children, and the tragic consequences of that view. -- <i>Copyright �1997, Kirkus Associates, LP.

Will they manage to pick up the thread of their strange love story, interrupted almost as soon as it began and then lost in the tides of history? The truth is that after such a long absence "their memories no longer match." We always believe that our memories coincide with those of the person we loved, that we experienced the same thing. But this is just an illusion. Then again, what can we expect of our weak memory? It records only "an insignificant, minuscule particle" of the past, "and no one knows why it's this bit and not any other bit." We live our lives sunk in a vast forgetting, a fact we refuse to recognize. Only those who return after twenty years, like Odysseus returning to his native Ithaca, can be dazzled and astounded by observing the goddess of ignorance firsthand.</p><p>Milan Kundera is the only author today who can take such dizzying concepts as absence, memory, forgetting, and ignorance, and transform them into material for a novel, masterfully orchestrating them into a polyphonic and moving work.</p></p><p>Bypassing the question of whether you can ever go home again, Milan Kundera's <i>Ignorance</i> tackles instead what happens when you actually get there. <i>Ignorance</i> is the story of two Czechs who meet by chance while traveling back to their homeland after 20 years in exile. Irena, who fled the country in 1968 with her now-deceased husband Martin, returns to Prague only to find coldness and indifference on the part of her former friends. Josef, who emigrated after the Russian invasion, is back in Prague to fulfill a wish of his beloved late wife. As fate would have it, the two have met before in their former lives, and the before-skirted passionate encounter is now destined to transpire. However, as in the story of Odysseus, which this novel so deliberately parallels, every homecoming brings with it a conflicting set of emotions so powerful that one has to question whether the voyage is really worth the pain. Expertly tackling the philosophical and emotional themes of nostalgia, memory, love, loss, and endurance, Kundera continues to astound readers with his masterful ability to understand and articulate issues so central to the human condition. <i>--Gisele Toueg</i><p>Milan Kundera is the author of the novels <em>The Joke, Farewell Waltz, Life Is Elsewhere, The Book of Laughter and Forgetting, The Unbearable Lightness of Being</em>, and <em>Immortality</em>, and the short-story collection <em>Laughable Loves</em>&#x2014;all originally written in Czech.

Her poems have appeared in <i>The New Yorker</i>, <i>The Paris Review</i>, and other journals. She was President of the Poetry Society of America from 1989-1995.In a successful effort to demonstrate the value of her oft-neglected medium, poet and memoirist Molly Peacock (Paradise, Piece by Piece, 1998, etc.) guides the reader through 13 of her favorite poems with grace, humor, and warmth. Peacock, who has been responsible for bringing poetry into the lives of millions of commuters via the nationwide Poetry in Motion series, now sets herself to the task of helping readers understand just what it is they are reading. Starting at her own childhood delight in the appearance and construction of words, and with a brief and painless stop to explain her basic terminology, Peacock moves on to detailed readings of her talismansthe poems that are emblematic of the various emotions or stages of her life. She presents a selection of poets diverse in both style and period. From the soothing repetition of the late Jane Kenyons hymnlike Let Evening Come, which she recommends as a spiritual tonic, to the unadorned free verse of Yusef Komunyakaas My Fathers Loveletters, with which she examines her own family life, Peacock rarely falters as she reveals the nuances of language and meaning inherent in each writers work. Occasionally the authors own poetic constructions obscure the clarity she is trying to elicit from the poems; but her sheer delight in them is infectious even when her point is unclear. The final chapter of the book is dedicated to advocating that readers start poetry circles, and Peacock has fellow poets suggest their own talisman poems for readers use. Poetry circles, the author writes, make you know you have a soul, and that other people do, too. A fervent claim, but one that Peacock has, with this book, made valid. Essential for poetry novices yet thoroughly enjoyable for initiates, this illuminating handbook is a joy. (author tour) -- <i>Copyright �1999, Kirkus Associates, LP.
